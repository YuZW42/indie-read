IndieArt Project <br>

This project aims to create an aggregator of artbooks from published by independent small presses. The projects aims to address the problem of a highly fragmented marketplace of niche books currently relying on social media, stand-alone websites and in-person bookfairs to sell and purchase books.. The project will seek to automate the aggregation of listings about artbooks and specialized artbook fairs, presented in a beautiful online setting worthy of the art books that are being featured while also sharing information about bookfairs.
