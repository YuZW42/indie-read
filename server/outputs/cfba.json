To design this pin, Gillian and Caroline printed a few different hand-shaped ornaments from the letterpress type collection using a Vandercook in the printshop. We chose to make a pin from this one for its size, classic little sleeve cuff, and etched shadows and fingernails. And this pin is actually the exact size of the printed image of the ornament in our collection! Draw attention to your fabulous style and taste, and celebrate letterpress printing history, with this gold-plated enamel lapel pin!

        "description": "By now the appropriation of Mallarmé, and in particular of his Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard, constitutes a genre of its own. Coup de Dés (Collection) attempts to gather, present and contextualize the numerous editions, re-editions, appropriations of Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard, including those attributed to Mallarmé as well as those which claimed by artists as new works in their own right. Moreover, the collection comprises publications, of whatever genre, which feature the word-constellation “Coup de Dés” on their cover. Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard Coup de Dés (Collection) Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard Un Coup de Dés (Collection) is a book about books, a collection, a gathering of evidence, a critical investigation, and an anthology of artists books. The book will catalogue all the books in its accompanying exhibition with meticulous bibliographic details, will be richly illustrated, and will be accompanied by critical essays written by leading scholars of the field such as Annette Gilbert, Craig Dworkin, Luc Boltanski/Arnauld Esquerre, Michalis Pichler and Ryoko Sekiguchi. Un Coup de Dés (Collection) “Books and Ideas Mallarmé” explores how Mallarmé’s Coup came about in the first place and how the absence of an authoritative edition contributed to keeping its exact status indeterminate, making it intertextual text par excellance. Coup par excellance Also, it looks at the Coup which has become a reference piece that gets appropriated with increasing frequency by contemporary artists and authors, who often operate independently from the commercial gallery system, gather around the networks of art book fairs, and have contributed to a wide-ranging bibliographic discourse within a field that has been subsumed under the umbrella term publishing as artistic practice. The research and the represented books all question the notion of the publication as a neutral container for information, and argue for a consideration of the physical shape and structure of text, of publications and of their materialization. Coup publishing as artistic practice Besides Stéphane Mallarmé, this anthology features books and bookworks by authors such as Derek Beaulieu, Jérémie Bennequin, Marcel Broodthaers4, burozoique, Bernard Chiavelli, Jim Clinefelter, Mario Diacono, Sammy Engramer, Cerith Wyn Evans, Ernest Fraenkel, Angela Grasser, Elsworth Kelly, La Bibliothèque Fantastique, Brian Larosche, Benjamin Lord, Michael Maranda, Guido Molinari, Monchas, Nontsikelelo Mutiti, Aurélie Noury, Raffaella Dell’Olga, Michalis Pichler, Nicolas Richard, Sam Sampson6,7,8, Camille Soula, Klara Vith5,6, Eric Zboya, and many more. The book is published on occasion of Exposition littéraire autour de Mallarmé at Center for Book Arts  (1/18/2024 – 5/1/2024).

Children’s Activity Books are a popular genre of publication meant to be in equal parts educational and entertaining. Often thematic in nature and printed on cheap gray paper, they are filled with coloring pages, and well known games and puzzles such as Word Search and Spot the Difference. From Can You See What I See? In Can You See What I See?, the coloring pages, rather than featuring popular cartoon characters or farm animals, consist of line-based compositions based on contemporary and historical military camouflage patterns from around the world. Word Search puzzles prompt viewers to identify missile and fighter jets that were named after animals or common weather phenomena. Spot the sniper, another set of images that appears throughout the book, is based on the Hidden Object Puzzle – a learning game asking children to find objects in a busy composition. Can You See What I See? Bringing together a wealth of archival research, with an observation of the artist’s own daughter’s education and media consumption, Can You See What I See? attempts to trace linkages between early childhood education and warfare, which, upon closer scrutiny, are revealed to be complex, multi-layered and highly disconcerting.

Positioning herself as an artist, activist, archivist, anthropologist, and religious figure, Kwon builds feminist utopias in the digital realm that liberate one from personal, familial, and historical trauma rooted in patriarchy. Central to her practice and substantial bodies of work is Leymusoom, an autobiographical feminist religion she initiated in 2017 as a form of personal resistance against misogyny and an ever-evolving framework for investigating her family histories. Kwon utilizes technologies such as digital archiving, 3D scanning, and animation as her ritualistic and shamanistic tools to regenerate her woman ancestors’ lives without constraints of time and space, and to queer her past, present, and utopian dreams.

        "description": "With texts by Keko Jackson and Matthew Grumbach “Allensworth is the first town in California to be founded, financed, and governed exclusively by Black people. Founded in 1908 as a symbol of freedom in the West, it is part of a long legacy of independent and autonomous communities created by revolutionaries and people who escaped enslavement. The town was started by Allen Allensworth, who was himself born into enslavement, and saw the land as an opportunity to live out a version of the American Dream. In its early years Allensworth saw a lot of success and self-sufficiency, establishing a free public library, access to inexpensive land and resources and a system of cooperative economics. However by 1915, a variety of causes including severe drought, racially motivated attacks, and the discovery of arsenic in the ground water ultimately led to the town’s decline. Today, Allensworth remains a state park which attempts to preserve the unique history of the land. While the demographics have largely shifted, Tulare County continues to be one of the poorest counties in the state. With this project I hope to share the story and history of a place I never learned about until coming across some boxes at my uncle’s house. By combining my own images with archival materials from his collection I attempt to bring together visual narratives both past and present to illustrate the evolution of a town that once meant so much to so many.” —Keko Jackson Keko Jackson is an artist and archivist based in Los Angeles. His work combines his interests in photography, history, and storytelling, often incorporating poetics of nature and landscape to reveal alternative histories and larger systemic inequities.",

The time span covered by the exhibition tracks the expansion of the conceptual movement, which began around 1960 and, depending on the geographical contexts, would last until the end of the 1980s. This was the time when artists’ books and other printed matter joined the list of new formats—installation, video, performance…—that were beginning to spread beyond the classic artistic genres and widen the field of possibilities for creators. *This catalog will ship on November 30, 2023. *This catalog will ship on November 30, 2023.",

This volume is contained within an acrylic vitrine as it it is an inaccessible artifact. The two other volumes are the “interpretations.” One is a redacted version of the text that is inspired by the idea that most constitutional zealots get their information from biased news commentators which is similar to reading a redacted text. The other interpretation is inspired by the idea that the other primary source of constitutional information is the internet. For this volume the original text was translated via Google into Esperanto, from Esperanto into Russian, from Russian into Mandarin, and from mandarin back into English. The resulting text is what was printed. Three Constitutions",

        "description": "In the wake of Covid, of not being able to travel as much as we liked, I began thinking about how the airplane as an erotic theater, a social text of secret motives, is structured like a language. As both a love letter and a lament to the airplane, it speaks to ways both individuals and meaning get transported to multiple and sometimes unexpected destinations; and how, like language itself, the airplane becomes a symbol of hope. As a border-blurring text incorporating elements of visual poetry/concrete work, asemic/sound poetry, theoretical discourse, and poetic, philosophical, and Kabbalistic aphorisms, Ærotomania highlights how language–an ever-swirling palimpsest of spectral voices, textures, whispers, and codes–transports us through passion, politics, pleasure, and promise as we negotiate loss and light towards new ways of seeing and being; and, like the airplane, flies through a variety of zones and registers, soaring to higher and higher levels, carrying its passengers through radically transformative possibilities. And though it can be read “in order,” it is organized as a “Shuffle Deck,” as often meaning get rerouted, or hijacked and thus can be read in any order whereby each card becomes a step in a trans/slantic journey of intermediatic play.",

While we have encountered a few obstacles in the production of the print edition of the magazine, we are greatly encouraged by the response we have received to the initiative and to the contents of Issue 1 online. We continue to see enthusiasm for a platform to engage with the artists’ book as an object and discuss how and why it works as an object—and for building and expanding a community with whom to share the excitement and fun of such conversations. 2022 has seen the return of in-person book fairs and the opportunity to come together to look at and talk about artists’ books along with questions of social responsibility, sustainability, and ethics. These topics are important parts of BAR and we hope you will join us in this dialogue. Add your voice and let us know what you think of our direction, design, and ideas and pitch us with your writing. Book Art Review  With Issue 2, we examine the “Hidden Parts of Design and Publishing.” How do the decisions that unfold during the process of bringing an artists’ book from conception to delivery reflect tradeoffs between an artist’s ideas and practical constraints of design, materials, and production? How do discussions between the collaborators impact the book? And how do the economics of the book shape the content and form? We are excited to have a range of writers exploring these questions across a broad spectrum of codex and non-traditional forms of the book. For Issue 2, we have partnered with Clifton Meador and his students at Appalachian State University to work on the design and production of this issue and are including their thoughts on going through this process with us. Finally, thank you for your patience as we smooth out our processes and settle on a more regular semi-annual cadence. Sincerely, The Editors Book Art Review (BAR) is a semiannual magazine dedicated to providing a forum for critical writing about book art and artist books. Book Art Review Book Art Review publishes two issues per year, with the first issue launching in Fall 2021. We want to raise the bar for book art criticism! BAR is our plan to make book art criticism more visible and more valuable, and to engage with a diverse group of writers and readers. Our launching manifesto calls for “New Book Art Criticism,” and in building that, our magazine will showcase a new kind of writing about artist books, one that focuses on the material, paginated, object qualities of the book.

        "description": "This edition translates Oppenheim’s recent rainbow collages into a combination of two new (to her practice) printmaking techniques. The risograph under-layer is created from three hand painted images layered together to create a rainbow. The black letterpress print on top is made from an image of a collage of screenprints of marbled paper (how is that for a visual game of telephone?) that has been reworked to create areas of space where it is possible to see through to the under-layer only. The narrative of the print is of a smiling bookbinder—or aspiring bookbinder—entering the magical jungle of bookbinding. Printed by Allison Carter-Beaulé at Center for Book Arts. About the Artist Sheryl Oppenheim was born in 1983 and raised in Orlando, Florida. She is a painter, paper marbler, and maker of illegible books, an idea she first became interested in after seeing the work of Bruno Munari, and through her proximity to books, bookbinders, and marbled paper at her first job in New York, at a bookbinding supply house. She began marbling paper in 2011 and began learning Suminagashi in 2016. Her artist books and prints are included in public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Watson Library, the Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center, the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Museum, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts. She has participated in recent exhibitions at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts, Sadie Halie Projects, Deanna Evans Projects, International Print Center New York, Small Editions, and the Cranbrook Museum of Art. Oppenheim received her BA from Brandeis University and her MFA from Temple University’s Tyler School of Art. She lives and works in New York City.",

        "description": "Before Social Media, There Were Cheap Copies. Did you ever wonder how artists and writers made zines and chapbooks before computers and photocopiers? This book is the culmination of over a decade of experiments, research, and tinkering with pre-digital duplication technology. It’s a DIY guide that explains the history and how-to of the mimeograph, hectograph, and spirit duplicators that were used by the avant-garde, political radicals, wannabe publishers, low-brow artists, and—perhaps most famously—by early zine makers. In addition to the how-to manual, the book is also a meditation on technology, highbrow vs lowbrow art, and rediscovering freedom in the non-digital world. This book is packed with info, instructions, illustrations, and reference material that will help you get started printing zines, posters, flyers, stickers, and more, without fancy equipment or expensive supplies. What the HELL are mimeos and hectos? Is a Spirit Duplicator some weird religious thing? The printing techniques featured in the book include low-cost, common “copying” methods that require little or no specialized training or equipment. Hectography Hecto appeared in the 1870s and was used widely for making office or school copies. It’s an amazingly simple technology, requiring no mechanical devices. By mixing gelatin and glycerin, you can make a printing pad that can produce 40 copies, be wiped clean, and be used again and again. Spirit Duplication An offshoot of hectography, spirit duplicator machines are a type of tabletop cylinder press. The master sheet is wrapped around a drum, which is hand-cranked or motorized. Known as “Ditto Machines, ” they make purple copies with an intoxicating smell loved by schoolkids everywhere. Mimeography Mimeos are stencil duplicators that can still be found second-hand, or you can make your own! Similar to silkscreen or Riso printing, mimeo offers a broad range of color choices and can print many more copies than the spirit method.",

        "description": "Sur Rodney (Sur) In the history of art, craft and conceptual art are often placed at odds. Craft emphasizes the materiality of the object, while conceptual art emphasizes the dematerialization of the object. But artists’ books offer a unique merging of these premises in the book’s status as a conceptual, tactile, and often ephemeral object. Successful artists’ books blend the craft of its making—paper, binding, scale, and printing method—with a conceptual premise tied to its status as time-based media in which the idea of the book—sequence, repetition, and audience activation—is essential to its meaning. While early exhibitions and writing on artists’ books maintained both these practices, including unique and small-edition handmade books that verge towards sculpture alongside mass-produced photobooks, paperbacks, and stapled zines, the history of artists’ books has since shifted, primitizing only the democracy of the genre and ghettoizing expensive, unique, and sculptural bookworks. The book focuses on book art production beginning in the mid 1960s that was exhibited from 1973-1996, drawing a—albeit zig-zag—line from the first cited US exhibition of artists’ books at Moore College to the founding of San Francisco Center for the Book, charting an expanding definition, practice, and legacy of bookmaking across the US. It will include a range of artists, from Liliana Porter, Howardena Pindell, and Suzanne Lacy, to Barton Lidice Beneš and Sas Colby. Leaning heavily on the archives and exhibition history of institutions devoted to craft and conceptual art, this exhibition will revisit who and what was considered an “artists’ book.” In doing so, Craft & Conceptual Art will shed new light on both ends of the sliding scale between craft and conceptual art, allowing us to better understand the growing field of artists’ book production. This fully illustrated catalogue features additional contributions by Sur Rodney (Sur), David Senior, Kayleigh Perkov, and Tara Aisha Willis, and a selection of reprinted historical texts.

This slow accumulation of paper mimicked the ethos and life cycle of bulletin boards, themselves public sites wherein people exchange messages, share demands, ask for help, broadcast their stories.

This is also another manuscript in the pile that mixes fine poetry with a great sense of humor. The poetic “I” takes on different shapes and sounds without losing its focus & the flow of the overall theme & music. Though the poet writes in English, I could also hear the impeccably luscious (as in sweet & appealing) sounds of Arabic between and above the lines.",

        "description": "by Mindell Dubansky with an introduction by Sidney E. Berger. Showcasing marbled paper, paste paper, fold-and-dye papers, and more, this book reveals a little-known arts phenomenon from its grass roots in the 1960s to artistic heights in the following decades Pattern and Flow chronicles the flourishing of American decorated paper arts beginning in the 1960s and extending to the 2000s, with an ongoing legacy today. As knowledge and skills were shared across a grass‐roots community in the 1960s, decorated paper became increasingly popular, with centers for the study of the book and paper arts emerging across the United States, and artists developing new, innovative styles of paper. The book begins with an introductory essay outlining the history of decorated paper arts in America up to the 1960s, followed by a chronological narrative, which surveys the development of the field and introduces the artists working from the 1960s to the 2000s, and an illustrated reference section with essential biographical and professional information for each artist. Designed to be an immersive experience, Pattern and Flow conveys the vivid visual world of American decorated paper, celebrating the variety and variations that are key features of the art. Stunning illustrations show designs with intricate, tessellated patterns and others that flow with forms and waves that seem liquid; some explore subtle, muted tones, while others are explosive in their use of brilliant colors. About the Author Mindell Dubansky is museum librarian for preservation, Sherman Fairchild Center for Book Conservation, Thomas J. Watson Library, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Sidney E. Berger is director emeritus of the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, MA.",

The contents—an unlikely mix of Hugo Ball, W.E.B. Du Bois, Adrian Piper, Gertrude Stein, Sun Ra, Stokely Carmichael, Gilles Deleuze—formed a kind of experimental canon, realized through what Pendleton calls “radical juxtaposition.” In 2017, Koenig Books published the Reader in a hardcover edition, with newly commissioned essays and additional writings by the artist.

Dear Lord, Please note that each print in this edition is unique; photos are for illustration purposes only. Matthew Dix is a writer from South Carolina. He studied poetry at the College of Charleston and Columbia University where he served as the poetry editor of Columbia Journal. He has two poems in current issue of Fence. Matthew Dix Roni Aviv is a New York-based visual artist whose practice is at the intersection of photography, text, drawing, and installation. In her work—which has been published and exhibited internationally—Aviv explores emotional residue through repetition and material change. She photographs different types of mark-makings performed onto paper using soaking, grinding, and tracing techniques. This practice is a visual and psychological inquiry into experiences and surfaces that are ubiquitous in everyday life and therefore often overlooked. Roni Aviv Produced in honor of the Spring 2022 Broadside Series reading on June 2, 2022, curated by Allison Carter-Beaulé. A recording of the event can be found here. here",
