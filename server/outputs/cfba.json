        "description": "From Can You See What I See? borrows from the format of the Children’s Activity Book to explore themes of visibility and violence in warfare and education. Children’s Activity Books are a popular genre of publication meant to be in equal parts educational and entertaining. Often thematic in nature and printed on cheap gray paper, they are filled with coloring pages, and well known games and puzzles such as Word Search and Spot the Difference. From Can You See What I See? In Can You See What I See?, the coloring pages, rather than featuring popular cartoon characters or farm animals, consist of line-based compositions based on contemporary and historical military camouflage patterns from around the world. Word Search puzzles prompt viewers to identify missile and fighter jets that were named after animals or common weather phenomena. Spot the sniper, another set of images that appears throughout the book, is based on the Hidden Object Puzzle – a learning game asking children to find objects in a busy composition. Can You See What I See? Bringing together a wealth of archival research, with an observation of the artist’s own daughter’s education and media consumption, Can You See What I See? attempts to trace linkages between early childhood education and warfare, which, upon closer scrutiny, are revealed to be complex, multi-layered and highly disconcerting. Can You See What I See? By Sandra Erbacher, afterword by Carmen Winant.",

Positioning herself as an artist, activist, archivist, anthropologist, and religious figure, Kwon builds feminist utopias in the digital realm that liberate one from personal, familial, and historical trauma rooted in patriarchy. Central to her practice and substantial bodies of work is Leymusoom, an autobiographical feminist religion she initiated in 2017 as a form of personal resistance against misogyny and an ever-evolving framework for investigating her family histories. Kwon utilizes technologies such as digital archiving, 3D scanning, and animation as her ritualistic and shamanistic tools to regenerate her woman ancestors’ lives without constraints of time and space, and to queer her past, present, and utopian dreams.

        "description": "With texts by Keko Jackson and Matthew Grumbach “Allensworth is the first town in California to be founded, financed, and governed exclusively by Black people. Founded in 1908 as a symbol of freedom in the West, it is part of a long legacy of independent and autonomous communities created by revolutionaries and people who escaped enslavement. The town was started by Allen Allensworth, who was himself born into enslavement, and saw the land as an opportunity to live out a version of the American Dream. In its early years Allensworth saw a lot of success and self-sufficiency, establishing a free public library, access to inexpensive land and resources and a system of cooperative economics. However by 1915, a variety of causes including severe drought, racially motivated attacks, and the discovery of arsenic in the ground water ultimately led to the town’s decline. Today, Allensworth remains a state park which attempts to preserve the unique history of the land. While the demographics have largely shifted, Tulare County continues to be one of the poorest counties in the state. With this project I hope to share the story and history of a place I never learned about until coming across some boxes at my uncle’s house. By combining my own images with archival materials from his collection I attempt to bring together visual narratives both past and present to illustrate the evolution of a town that once meant so much to so many.” —Keko Jackson Keko Jackson is an artist and archivist based in Los Angeles. His work combines his interests in photography, history, and storytelling, often incorporating poetics of nature and landscape to reveal alternative histories and larger systemic inequities.",

The time span covered by the exhibition tracks the expansion of the conceptual movement, which began around 1960 and, depending on the geographical contexts, would last until the end of the 1980s. This was the time when artists’ books and other printed matter joined the list of new formats—installation, video, performance…—that were beginning to spread beyond the classic artistic genres and widen the field of possibilities for creators. *This catalog will ship on November 30, 2023. *This catalog will ship on November 30, 2023.",

This volume is contained within an acrylic vitrine as it it is an inaccessible artifact. The two other volumes are the “interpretations.” One is a redacted version of the text that is inspired by the idea that most constitutional zealots get their information from biased news commentators which is similar to reading a redacted text. The other interpretation is inspired by the idea that the other primary source of constitutional information is the internet. For this volume the original text was translated via Google into Esperanto, from Esperanto into Russian, from Russian into Mandarin, and from mandarin back into English. The resulting text is what was printed. Three Constitutions",

        "description": "In the wake of Covid, of not being able to travel as much as we liked, I began thinking about how the airplane as an erotic theater, a social text of secret motives, is structured like a language. As both a love letter and a lament to the airplane, it speaks to ways both individuals and meaning get transported to multiple and sometimes unexpected destinations; and how, like language itself, the airplane becomes a symbol of hope. As a border-blurring text incorporating elements of visual poetry/concrete work, asemic/sound poetry, theoretical discourse, and poetic, philosophical, and Kabbalistic aphorisms, Ærotomania highlights how language–an ever-swirling palimpsest of spectral voices, textures, whispers, and codes–transports us through passion, politics, pleasure, and promise as we negotiate loss and light towards new ways of seeing and being; and, like the airplane, flies through a variety of zones and registers, soaring to higher and higher levels, carrying its passengers through radically transformative possibilities. And though it can be read “in order,” it is organized as a “Shuffle Deck,” as often meaning get rerouted, or hijacked and thus can be read in any order whereby each card becomes a step in a trans/slantic journey of intermediatic play.",

While we have encountered a few obstacles in the production of the print edition of the magazine, we are greatly encouraged by the response we have received to the initiative and to the contents of Issue 1 online. We continue to see enthusiasm for a platform to engage with the artists’ book as an object and discuss how and why it works as an object—and for building and expanding a community with whom to share the excitement and fun of such conversations. 2022 has seen the return of in-person book fairs and the opportunity to come together to look at and talk about artists’ books along with questions of social responsibility, sustainability, and ethics. These topics are important parts of BAR and we hope you will join us in this dialogue. Add your voice and let us know what you think of our direction, design, and ideas and pitch us with your writing. Book Art Review  With Issue 2, we examine the “Hidden Parts of Design and Publishing.” How do the decisions that unfold during the process of bringing an artists’ book from conception to delivery reflect tradeoffs between an artist’s ideas and practical constraints of design, materials, and production? How do discussions between the collaborators impact the book? And how do the economics of the book shape the content and form? We are excited to have a range of writers exploring these questions across a broad spectrum of codex and non-traditional forms of the book. For Issue 2, we have partnered with Clifton Meador and his students at Appalachian State University to work on the design and production of this issue and are including their thoughts on going through this process with us. Finally, thank you for your patience as we smooth out our processes and settle on a more regular semi-annual cadence. Sincerely, The Editors Book Art Review (BAR) is a semiannual magazine dedicated to providing a forum for critical writing about book art and artist books. Book Art Review Book Art Review publishes two issues per year, with the first issue launching in Fall 2021. We want to raise the bar for book art criticism! BAR is our plan to make book art criticism more visible and more valuable, and to engage with a diverse group of writers and readers. Our launching manifesto calls for “New Book Art Criticism,” and in building that, our magazine will showcase a new kind of writing about artist books, one that focuses on the material, paginated, object qualities of the book.

The risograph under-layer is created from three hand painted images layered together to create a rainbow. The black letterpress print on top is made from an image of a collage of screenprints of marbled paper (how is that for a visual game of telephone?) that has been reworked to create areas of space where it is possible to see through to the under-layer only. The narrative of the print is of a smiling bookbinder—or aspiring bookbinder—entering the magical jungle of bookbinding. Printed by Allison Carter-Beaulé at Center for Book Arts. About the Artist Sheryl Oppenheim was born in 1983 and raised in Orlando, Florida. She is a painter, paper marbler, and maker of illegible books, an idea she first became interested in after seeing the work of Bruno Munari, and through her proximity to books, bookbinders, and marbled paper at her first job in New York, at a bookbinding supply house. She began marbling paper in 2011 and began learning Suminagashi in 2016. Her artist books and prints are included in public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Watson Library, the Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center, the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Museum, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts. She has participated in recent exhibitions at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts, Sadie Halie Projects, Deanna Evans Projects, International Print Center New York, Small Editions, and the Cranbrook Museum of Art. Oppenheim received her BA from Brandeis University and her MFA from Temple University’s Tyler School of Art. She lives and works in New York City.",

        "description": "Before Social Media, There Were Cheap Copies. Did you ever wonder how artists and writers made zines and chapbooks before computers and photocopiers? This book is the culmination of over a decade of experiments, research, and tinkering with pre-digital duplication technology. It’s a DIY guide that explains the history and how-to of the mimeograph, hectograph, and spirit duplicators that were used by the avant-garde, political radicals, wannabe publishers, low-brow artists, and—perhaps most famously—by early zine makers. In addition to the how-to manual, the book is also a meditation on technology, highbrow vs lowbrow art, and rediscovering freedom in the non-digital world. This book is packed with info, instructions, illustrations, and reference material that will help you get started printing zines, posters, flyers, stickers, and more, without fancy equipment or expensive supplies. What the HELL are mimeos and hectos? Is a Spirit Duplicator some weird religious thing? The printing techniques featured in the book include low-cost, common “copying” methods that require little or no specialized training or equipment. Hectography Hecto appeared in the 1870s and was used widely for making office or school copies. It’s an amazingly simple technology, requiring no mechanical devices. By mixing gelatin and glycerin, you can make a printing pad that can produce 40 copies, be wiped clean, and be used again and again. Spirit Duplication An offshoot of hectography, spirit duplicator machines are a type of tabletop cylinder press. The master sheet is wrapped around a drum, which is hand-cranked or motorized. Known as “Ditto Machines, ” they make purple copies with an intoxicating smell loved by schoolkids everywhere. Mimeography Mimeos are stencil duplicators that can still be found second-hand, or you can make your own! Similar to silkscreen or Riso printing, mimeo offers a broad range of color choices and can print many more copies than the spirit method.",

        "description": "Sur Rodney (Sur) In the history of art, craft and conceptual art are often placed at odds. Craft emphasizes the materiality of the object, while conceptual art emphasizes the dematerialization of the object. But artists’ books offer a unique merging of these premises in the book’s status as a conceptual, tactile, and often ephemeral object. Successful artists’ books blend the craft of its making—paper, binding, scale, and printing method—with a conceptual premise tied to its status as time-based media in which the idea of the book—sequence, repetition, and audience activation—is essential to its meaning. While early exhibitions and writing on artists’ books maintained both these practices, including unique and small-edition handmade books that verge towards sculpture alongside mass-produced photobooks, paperbacks, and stapled zines, the history of artists’ books has since shifted, primitizing only the democracy of the genre and ghettoizing expensive, unique, and sculptural bookworks. The book focuses on book art production beginning in the mid 1960s that was exhibited from 1973-1996, drawing a—albeit zig-zag—line from the first cited US exhibition of artists’ books at Moore College to the founding of San Francisco Center for the Book, charting an expanding definition, practice, and legacy of bookmaking across the US. It will include a range of artists, from Liliana Porter, Howardena Pindell, and Suzanne Lacy, to Barton Lidice Beneš and Sas Colby. Leaning heavily on the archives and exhibition history of institutions devoted to craft and conceptual art, this exhibition will revisit who and what was considered an “artists’ book.” In doing so, Craft & Conceptual Art will shed new light on both ends of the sliding scale between craft and conceptual art, allowing us to better understand the growing field of artists’ book production. This fully illustrated catalogue features additional contributions by Sur Rodney (Sur), David Senior, Kayleigh Perkov, and Tara Aisha Willis, and a selection of reprinted historical texts.

The works were double sided with painted text facing the street (including contributions from Lukaza and others noted in the bibliography below) and with various patterns facing into the bookstore. This slow accumulation of paper mimicked the ethos and life cycle of bulletin boards, themselves public sites wherein people exchange messages, share demands, ask for help, broadcast their stories.

They dissect and image, line, floor, and/or ceiling while filtering a changing view. They give rhythm under the stillness. This mismatch of grids can be quiet, soft, indifferent. This is a second edition of 125 books.",

        "description": "by Mindell Dubansky with an introduction by Sidney E. Berger. Showcasing marbled paper, paste paper, fold-and-dye papers, and more, this book reveals a little-known arts phenomenon from its grass roots in the 1960s to artistic heights in the following decades Pattern and Flow chronicles the flourishing of American decorated paper arts beginning in the 1960s and extending to the 2000s, with an ongoing legacy today. As knowledge and skills were shared across a grass‐roots community in the 1960s, decorated paper became increasingly popular, with centers for the study of the book and paper arts emerging across the United States, and artists developing new, innovative styles of paper. The book begins with an introductory essay outlining the history of decorated paper arts in America up to the 1960s, followed by a chronological narrative, which surveys the development of the field and introduces the artists working from the 1960s to the 2000s, and an illustrated reference section with essential biographical and professional information for each artist. Designed to be an immersive experience, Pattern and Flow conveys the vivid visual world of American decorated paper, celebrating the variety and variations that are key features of the art. Stunning illustrations show designs with intricate, tessellated patterns and others that flow with forms and waves that seem liquid; some explore subtle, muted tones, while others are explosive in their use of brilliant colors. About the Author Mindell Dubansky is museum librarian for preservation, Sherman Fairchild Center for Book Conservation, Thomas J. Watson Library, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Sidney E. Berger is director emeritus of the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, MA.",

        "description": "Books Revisited, presents artworks, artists’ books, and bookworks across time and media that play with and challenge how narrative, historical truths, and knowledge occupy space within and beyond the material and conceptual boundaries of books. The eleven artists and collectives in the exhibition use existing books as raw material—whether that be an address book, an art historical catalog, the Bible, an encyclopedia, a geometry manual, a novel, or a reader—as the site for the reinterpretation of texts and images, the open-ended possibilities of authorship, and the inscriptions of new subjectivities. Books Revisited posits that while books have historical resonances rooted in the specifics of time and place, they eventually circulate, temporally and geographically, cross-pollinating to create new understandings of history and one’s place in it.

        "description": "In 2011, artist Adam Pendleton assembled Black Dada Reader, a compendium of texts, documents and positions that elucidated a practice and ethos of “Black Dada.” Resembling a school course reader, the book was a spiral-bound series of photocopies and collages, originally intended only for personal reference, and eventually distributed informally to friends and colleagues. The contents—an unlikely mix of Hugo Ball, W.E.B. Du Bois, Adrian Piper, Gertrude Stein, Sun Ra, Stokely Carmichael, Gilles Deleuze—formed a kind of experimental canon, realized through what Pendleton calls “radical juxtaposition.” In 2017, Koenig Books published the Reader in a hardcover edition, with newly commissioned essays and additional writings by the artist.

Shane McCrae Vanessa Sandoval is a visual artist with practice in the fields of sculpture, drawing, performance, and installation. She is interested in exploring and questioning the separation between nature and culture, and how bodies are expressions of ecological relations. Sandoval uses condensation and the practice of counting as part of her creative process. Recently, she has been writing essays and doing performances that examine human ways of condensing knowledge in objects and devices such as encyclopedias, habitat dioramas, and wonder cabinets, in order to point out the ideological relations that structure our relation with the world.

My wife, Noni Reisner, had dementia I cared for her for 6 years. She was a very funny, witty person, and that sense of humor and wit continued during her dementia. She would say these short sayings and I started to write them down on any piece of paper I could grab. Backs of envelopes, shopping lists, etc. While caring for her I did little artwork but I did make a few drawings. A few years after she died I started the watercolors and drawings that make up this book. It was the book designer Laura Lindgren who suggested that I combine them with Noni’s sayings that I collected and make a book which she helped design. This book is a kind of visual memoir of that difficult yet spiritual time.",

        "description": "About the Broadside Workspace Artist-in-Residence Rhonda Khalifeh Cover Up Kyle Carrero Lopez Black Spirits Khalifeh felt that many other people could relate to the experience of being required to wear modest clothing in order to enter a sacred space. At one point during the Covid-19 pandemic, Kahlifeh had to choose whether to don a communal headscarf so she could enter a mosque in Istanbul’s Taksim square or to forgo the experience entirely and wait outside. In the end, she chose the latter option. For this broadside, Khalifeh created a digital collage from a scan of a textile and a photograph she took in 2010 of a Christian monastery near the village of Rankus, which is located north of Damascus. Khalifeh then transferred the image onto a polymer plate and printed it alongside handset type on a Vandercook letterpress proof press. Although some of the details of the collage were lost in this process, Kahlifeh feels that the fuzzy, fragmented quality lends itself nicely to the overall mood of Carrero Lopez’s poem. Colophon Designed and printed by Rhonda Khalifeh at Center for Book Arts in honor of the poet’s reading on November 11, 2021. The text was handset in Verona, Goudy Oldstyle, and Lightline Gothic.

Interweaving stark photography with excerpts from Virgilio Pinera, Santos shows us the vulnerable world of these night creatures, the young gay and transgender individuals who gather at the wall. Once Hernández Santos made his prints, he used transfer lettering to literally press onto his images the words of the late, gay, Cuban poet and playwright, Virgilio Pinera. El muro is a collection of 10 offset triptych photographs and 2 bilingual essays by the artist and the Cuban ethnographer Abel Sierra.

Art, Craft & Community presents a thriving ecosystem of papermakers, printers, bookbinders, artists, designers and publishers from round the world. They draw on traditional skills, art and experimentation to make books that matter today. In twenty-six profiles – spanning traditional craftspeople to modern makers reimagining the book for new audiences – and contributions from experts, we are given an insight into the history and contemporary context of the processes behind the books.

Everything Everything frosted Everything must go Available Affordable pricing Moving Running or not It’s time to let go Come now this won’t last Wholesale & retail New & used Part time or full time Revised All ways All uses considered Everything a blessing In addition, García used 45 metal type specimens from CBA’s collection (listed in the colophon) for the work. The combined effect serves as a visual reminder of how García accumulated the text from many disparate sources. Colophon VOICES is the result of many days of exploring the streets of New York, photographing and hand-setting words, phrases, and experiences encountered there.

The exhibition is on view at CBA’s Manhattan location from July 9th- September 18th 2021. This manifesto talks to core of GenderFail collecting and archiving practices that looks to the softness of the collected and archived book as a metaphor for the type of content that are housed within. The GenderFail Archive Project is a socially engaged reading room that looks at archiving as a social activity. The project stems from GenderFail’s desire to share the publications from their personal library and give a platform to other publishers that they cherish. Imperfect Archiving/Archiving as Practice shows its full collection of over 1,000 art books, artist books and zines for the first time. GenderFail will also be showing GenderFail Archive Project Bookcases, which are collaborative sculptures made with artists that reimagine how books can be displayed in reading room installations. The GenderFail Archive Project has installed reading rooms within various institutions such as MoMA PS1, The International Center of Photography, The Studio Museum of Harlem, EFA Project Space and many others.

Imperfect Archiving/Archiving as Practice Be Oakley, (formally known as Brett Suemnicht) Born 1991 in Clearwater, Florida; is a writer, facilitator and publisher based in Brooklyn, NY. Oakley’s projects looks to what Fred Moten calls “the politics of the mess” by framing their identity as a white non-binary queer person in its intersections with failure and internationality. In 2015 they started GenderFail, a publishing and programming initiative that seeks to encourage projects that foster an intersectional queer subjectivity. Their work has been shown in programs and exhibitions at MoMA PS1 (NYC), the Studio Museum of Harlem, The International Center of Photography (NYC), Vox Populi and Sediment Arts. Their publications can be found in the library collections of The Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney Museum, The Met Museum, and many others. Be Oakley Started in 2015, GenderFail is an imperfect programming and publishing platform that highlights intersectional queer subjectivity. Our projects look at various forms of failure – from personal, public, and political perspectives – as a boundless form of creative potential. GenderFail is fueled by the messiness of collaboration, education, and community to push our goals of failing forward. We have been a part of projects, programming and exhibitions including The Studio Museum in Harlem (Radical Reading Room, 2019), Williams College Museum of Art (Queer Zines, 2019), MoMA PS1 (Past and Future Fictions, 2018), The International Center of Photography (Queering the Collection, 2018), among many others.

In this exhibition, the book is simultaneously complemented and subverted. Artists investigate the tradition of artist’s books as artistic structure, storytelling in visual art, the narrative possibilities of language, and the object-ness of book material in circulation. Including prints, sculptures, and works on paper that explore the design and aesthetics of language, this exhibition celebrates the relationship between reading and making.

In 1972, Carrión took a single poem by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and churned it through 44 typographic and procedural permutations. The publication of Sonnet(s), one of the first of his influential “bookworks,” signaled a departure from Carrión’s earlier writing practice. A pioneer in conceptualizing the artists book, mail art, and what today might be called social practice, Carrión, who died in 1989, has only recently been recognized with a retrospective exhibit at Reina Sofia (Madrid) and Museo Jumex (Mexico City).",

My first thoughts were to use a combination of photographs from different places I’ve made through the years, but at the end this one taken from New York High Line seemed perfect for the feelings that the poem imprinted on me. The final image is a ghost city; abandoned machines, a flag and some other elements combined with the tones of blue and effects of the cyanotype. Also each print is different and it is something I was looking for, the silkscreened poem has a background that is constantly changing in seek of reinforce the strength of this powerful literary piece by Eléna Rivera.” – Oswaldo García Designed and printed by Oswaldo García and Explet Studio at Querétaro, México in honor of Eléna Rivera’s reading on June 3rd, 2021 at Center for Book Arts, New York, USA.

        "description": "Poem by Heidi Andrea Restrepo Rhodes, designed & printed by Matt Collins at Center for Book Arts in honor of the poet’s reading on May 20, 2021. Printed in Chisel & Baskerville. Ornaments by Mackellars, Smiths & Jordan c. 1895. Edition of 100. Heidi Andrea Restrepo Rhodes Matt Collins “When I first read Heidi’s poem “Lessons”, her direct and elegiac images called for a light touch. Later we spoke, and Heidi gave me some historical background. I sought to get some of the Colombia pais into the design. pais My first objective was to make use of the vast foundry type collection at the Center for Book Arts. I was instantly drawn to Baskerville for the poem’s text. Baskerville has both a serenity and directness that appealed to me. After a few days of setting and resetting type, I was discouraged because this particular font was worn and uneven. I came to see that the careworn type was just the thing for Heidi’s poem, which has so much to say about the past. I began experimenting with the overall design and came up with a very classical, almost rigid frame-within-frame element that contained the title and Heidi’s name. My idea was to let the text stand resolutely on its own, separate from the other material. We both ended up agreeing that the frame structure was indeed limiting, even distracting. We went back and forth on the use of illustration. I ended up using one small ornament designed by MacKellars, Smiths, & Jordan c. 1895. My initial thoughts as to use the whole panel of the MacKellars series, but again, decided it could be confusing. As we continued, the design became so simple it was in danger fo disappearing like a stranger. I thoughts that by using a really textured, lush paper I could recapture the text. I chose an ecru Crane’s Lettra; it has a dense pillowy feel that takes the ink. In the end, a deep red typographic flourish was needed to balance out the page’s austerity. I chose Stephenson Blake’s inline Chisel typeface for the title because it ads height without adding weight.” – Matt Collins",

The poem is set in helvetica, with stymie for the colophon and a mix of typefaces for the title, all from the Center’s collection. The fluorescent lines are printed from linoleum blocks.” “In designing the broadside for We Gentle Beasts I wanted to respond to the earthiness and sense of movement in the poem. I was thinking about ways to suggest old and new, living in the present moment and eulogizing the past. Points of inspiration were classic French title pages, which are strict in their alignment and often feature a beautiful mix of black and red inks, and playful twentieth century designers like Ettore Sottsass and Nathalie du Pasquier. To me the decorative letters used in the title, particularly the more baroque ones, almost become the embodiment of the poem’s protagonists.” “Aurora’s broadside is printed on 300# Crane’s Lettra, which is an all cotton, heavier weight but very soft paper that takes an impression nicely.

Originally an installation, this work by collaborators Patricia Silva and Lyall Harris finds form in an artists’ book. The Interpreted Object In The Interpreted Object, forgotten objects find new artistic and poetic expression. The artists searched for quasi-obsolete objects where the original purpose or use had been lost. The “action” intrinsic to the object—a knife cuts, a spoon stirs—was therefore also lost, which allowed the artists to assign new actions (“title” verbs), according to what they perceived to be the “spirit” of the object. Along with the verbs came poetic phrases that further interpreted the objects and imbued them with meaning. Verbs and phrases found form in corresponding booklets, one for each object. Through this process of (re)discovery, Silva and Harris revisit, in new ways, familiar themes of motherhood, loss, memory, and relationships. The Interpreted Object,  This artists’ book presents a compilation of the objects and texts in a single publication.",

        "description": "Interspecies Futures [IF] is the first survey of bookworks by leading international practitioners from the contemporary fields of bio-art and speculative design who have turned to the book as a tool for the proposal of alternative human-nonhuman scenarios. Interspecies Futures [IF] Informed by methods from conceptual art, posthumanism, biotechnology (CRISPR), and emerging interfaces (AI, VR, 3D printing), these artists produce documents that defy the borders between fiction and reality. In their hands field guides, lost diaries, investigative dossiers, lab journals, corporate catalogues become portals into multiple interspecies possibilities. [IF] introduces practices that cover a large range of positions toward the nonhuman. Some of the books propose new eco-conscious alternatives, as in Non Flowers, 2021 by Thomas Pausz (FR/IS). Other books imply trans-species dreams such as the 2046 diaries of a scientist in Aurelia Immortal, 2017 by Javier Viver (ES). Some works pose new dilemmas, as in Dodo in the Room, 2019 by Ege Kokel (TU/AT), which predicts a wave of de-extinction pets. Some of the futures imagined are collaborative, like the sonic experiments in Transversal is a Loop, 2019 by Saša Spačal (SI). We even find proposals for post COVID-19 realities, as in Kuang-Yi Ku (TW) whose Tiger Penis Project, 2018, imagines the end of wildlife trade in Chinese medicine via lab-grown animal parts; or Noam Youngrak Son (KR), whose Becoming a Bat, 2021, appeals to solidarity with virus-carrying species via a book designed to be perceived primarily by nonhumans.

        "description": "Quiéreme Mucho (Love me a lot) is a selection of recent and old work by Cristina Velásquez. Her image-making process consists in two moments. The first one, in which she let’s herself guide by intuition to shoot the images; and the second, in which she edits and dissects the work, looking at it through a critical lens while she questions her decisions, crops the images, and examines her impulses. Quiéreme Mucho “The play of power is essential to the understanding of photography. With time, I’ve realized that through photography, I can subvert the dominant structures of power that for years have separated people from one another. Photography allows me to wrestle with the complexities of the colonial-white-mono-narrative in my past and present, in an effort to create an alternative one in the future. I am interested in acknowledging the subjectivities that permeate the act of representing —oneself, and the other— starting with the power imbalance inherent to the medium, that mirrors a larger system of social editing. Through photography, I have a chance to reclaim my own identity, and by doing so, complicate the visual alphabet and resist the threats of cultural assimilation, which feel very violent to me. I understand picture making as one of the most effective ways to shift narratives about who counts in the world. “—CV",

The pictures in Sangre de mi Sangre were selected for this collection of over 300 35mm rolls and edited by artist Justine Kurland. Sangre de mi Sangre “I married Dylan on March 6th 2020, a week before the Covid pandemic blew up and a lock-down was imposed in New York City. As newlyweds, we would be unable to leave the house for months, cementing the bond between us in ways unimaginable just weeks before. In those intensely close quarters, I applied for my marriage green card which required me to prove that my relationship was real. My love for Dylan is certain and undeniable but suddenly I was being asked to demonstrate it in a tangible way for the scrutiny of an anonymous immigration officer. Bureaucrats boil relationships down to leases, bank statements, and anodyne group pictures. Sangre de mi Sangre is my response to that reductive requirement imposed on love. The pictures within tell the story of intimacy, affection, and trust in a world turned upside down.”—MNS Sangre de mi Sangre",

The publication includes both images from her family album and pictures she has been taking of the place and its inhabitants since 2005. “My parents emigrated from the Dominican Republic to the United States in the 70s. In the 90s they moved to Washington Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan also known as “Little DR.” They created a home in a three-bedroom apartment in a fifth-floor walk-up on West 176th Street in 1995. It was an upgrade from their previous one-bedroom two blocks away. Now as they try to move into a home with an elevator, dishwasher, and seemingly better amenities for older adults, they are facing the challenges of letting go of belongings that do not fit into a smaller space and saying goodbye to their apartment on West 176th St. This is a look back at a family staple—the first stop for relatives emigrating from the Dominican Republic—and how it’s changed over time.” —gm",

Whether used as a tool to recall history, preserve identity, or to transmit morals, it is a means for understanding and sharing human experiences. Oral traditions and the written word are perhaps the most obvious modes of communication associated with storytelling, however visual artists have equally engaged with it throughout history, and continue to do so today. Curated by Lila Nazemian, “I open my eyes and see myself under a tree laden with fruit that I cannot name” is an exhibition entitled after a line in Sinan Antoon’s latest novel, The Book of Collateral Damage, featured alongside Hadieh Shafie and Zarina, whose works are deeply embedded within narrative mediums. Through the use of paper, printing methods and orality, each artist produces works that function as allegories for sharing stories of home and of their lived experiences. “I open my eyes and see myself under a tree laden with fruit that I cannot name” The Book of Collateral Damage",

        "description": "If art is a means of self-knowledge (the “self” here referring to either the artist or the audience and their knowing of others, and the world we live in), then the way we, as the audience, encounter artwork and comprehend its conceptual or aesthetic elements becomes relevant to the way we perceive ourselves and our greater surroundings. What makes one’s interaction of an artwork different than another’s? Why does an artwork push one person to think and leaves the other unaffected? To find the answers to such questions, I put less emphasis on the content and subject matter of the artwork in this exhibition and focus on the ways one might perceive the artwork. As the sense of sight often gets the most attention in the process of taking in an artwork, Out of Sight, Beyond Touch aims to remind one of the crucial role touch has in our perception of works of art.

The photographs were notable for their distanced view of both high and low strata of American society and the book as a whole created a complicated portrait of the period, interpreted as skeptical of contemporary values and evocative of ubiquitous loneliness. The Americans The curators of this exhibition, Emilie Ahern & Sherri Littlefield, have reflected on what it means to be “American.” Having multicultural backgrounds and being raised in the States has given them both moments of confusion and frustration, and has led them to wonder what this country has to do with personal identity. When forming this exhibition, the curators presented themselves, artists, editors, leaders and everyday-people with the question – “What is American culture today, and what does an American look like?”",

The book includes four original lithographs printed on hand dyed Torinoko Paper. The edition is comprised of fifteen books, five artist’s proofs and one printer’s proof. Lithographs were printed by James Miller at Downstairs Editions. The publishing, book design and binding is by R Press. Matertera means “maternal aunt” in Latin, and the work is inspired by the sisters of the mothers (and fathers) who are acrobats, magicians, lovers, confidantes, friends, believers, companions, adventurers, and divine mysteries. The artist made the book in dedication to her dearest Aunt Patti who had just passed over and to my Aunt Marguerite who was just turning 100. The artist considers this project a dedication to the women, related by blood or by friendship, alive or now as ancestors, who surround and inspire us to keep the flame burning, carry the torch, illuminate the way.",

        "description": "After my father’s death, I discovered a box of letters written to my mother one year after they were married. They were written by him during a trip to his birthplace, Velbert, Germany, from which he emigrated to Canada after WW2. He was returning to visit his family for what he suspected would be his last visit with his aging mother. It was his first trip away from my mother. The box contained both postcards and letters – a dichotomy of the public and private; the public places and common language of postcards that we use to mark our travels, and the private sentiments we impart to loved ones in letters from places far away. I have used photographs taken during the trip to reflect specific places he visited while in Germany, and have picked out both intimate and everyday phrases from the letters to weave into these images. The intention is to reflect the unseen presence these places now held for him, that of my mother waiting back at home – a juxtaposition of public and private, memory, absence and place. Hand bound, 5-panel, double-sided French fold accordion gicleé on Hahnemuhle paper, in a hand bound gicleé envelope on Hahnemuhle paper. Archival quality. Envelope: 7” x 9.5”, Accordion book: 6” x 8.75” (closed) 6” x 39.25” (extended)",

Rather than introducing new materials to express recycling or upcycling, this project uses plants that are now growing on the site naturally, looking to the future of the land and expressing the possibilities in renewal.",

Five Oceans in a Teaspoon is a book and multimedia project written by muckraking journalist/poet Dennis J Bernstein, visualized by pioneer designer/author Warren Lehrer. A large collection of short visual poems, Five Oceans in a Teaspoon consists of a book (Paper Crown Press), animations, an exhibition, and reading/performances by the author and artist. Five Oceans in a Teaspoon Five Oceans in a Teaspoon In 1979, Bernstein and Lehrer began working on a book of short poems, originally titled Stretch Marks. Instead of completing that book, Dennis and Warren leapt into writing their first play together, and over the intervening years they collaborated on three books including French Fries (now considered a classic in experimental literature and expressive typography). A few years ago they began collaborating again on poems. Dennis’ writing. Warren’s visualizations. Now, on the 40th anniversary of their original effort, they have completed the book of poems. Comprised of 225 poems (including a dozen or so from the original effort), Five Oceans in a Teaspoon reflects Bernstein’s life experiences and the artistry of Bernstein and Lehrer at the height of their creative powers.

A ‘catalogue dé-raisonné’ of all the printed matter produced by BGP, it is complemented by critical essays and first-hand texts that explore the working methods (economy and autonomy of production, distribution of books via post) and document the international influence of this short-lived ‘community of duplicators, printers, and artisans’.

        "description": "An essay on the modes of re-enactments, appropriation or reinterpretations of artists’ books. Artists’ books, which once allowed artists to avoid meddlesome institutions and galleries in producing and distributing artistic work, today have a paradoxical existence. On the one hand, there are the extremely rare founding books, termed ‘first edition’ or ‘original’, and, on the other hand, there are ‘facsimile’ editions, which entered the artist’s book realm to counteract the scarcity of the originals by offering re-enactments and reinterpretations of famous titles. This essay underlines a curiosity for practices of appropriation by artists and publishers, and aims to expose methods and discourses in the production of facsimile artists’ books. artistsbookreviews.com Rob van Leijsen (born 1983 in Tilburg, The Netherlands, lives and works in Geneva) is a multidisciplinary graphic designer. His practice focuses mainly on cultural projects, notably in the fields of publishing design and research. He is currently head of his his own graphic design studio in Geneva, in parallel to his teaching position in the visual communication department at HEAD – Geneva. In 2012, he obtains his master’s degree “Design, Orientation, Spaces and Communication” at the HEAD – Geneva with the project Art Handling in Oblivion, an exhibition catalogue bringing together five art collections that were stolen during various wars. This book is published by Edition Fink (Zürich) in 2014 and was awarded as one of the “Most Beautiful Swiss Books” of 2014. The book also received an honorary diploma at the competition “Best Book Design from all over the World” in Leipzig in 2015. In 2016 he founded Dabook with Demian Conrad. Dabook is a publishing house which aims to promote Swiss design.",

        "description": "Dignidad is an artist’s book that documents a two years research-based project on Colonia Dignidad, which highlights the human rights violations committed in an isolated settlement established in the 1960s by Nazis in Chile before and after the dictatorship of Pinochet. Multiple crimes against humanity, including torture, execution, and child abuse were committed inside the enclave. Today the various criminal cases remain primarily unprosecuted and unresolved, due to the lack of political will, unresolved issues of legal jurisdiction, statute of limitations, the death of most of the principal offenders and the questionable legal status of the Colonia Dignidad which had been recently re-incorporated as an autonomous agricultural production center and renamed Villa Baviera. Dignidad “I define this artist’s book as a political abstraction, which refers to the history of Colonia Dignidad through the construction and deconstruction of symbols of power. The spaces of segregation and repression can be imagined spatially and conceptually through the architecture of the bunkers of the Colonia Dignidad period. The physical transformation of the sculpture manifests as the history’s relevance and resonance of the ideologies evoked by symbols and spaces” This project is a collaboration with the National Archives of Chile, The Association of Memory and Human Rights Colonia Dignidad and Winfried Hempel.",

        "description": "For the past few years I’ve been taking photos of trees in winter, their naked branches so stark and poetic against the bright grey winter skies, sometimes, less and less each year, covered in a perfect blanket of white snow. Most of the time these weren’t trees found deep in the woods, but individuals, maybe in a park, on the side of the road, in the middle of town, in a back yard, trees that lived where people lived and stood out for their personalities. Trees in Winter is the result of these photos. It is a process driven book. I had been experimenting with CMYK printing and wanted to try to work with this pro- cess on the Vandercook using photopolymer plates. The resulting book, made late in 2018 and 2019, is the culmination of several months of test plates and prints. There were many challenges to working with this technique, but the resulting images have a vintage, some- times haunting quality. The CMYK prints are juxtaposed with handmade suminagashi mar- bling, the patterns of which are reminiscent of tree rings or woodgrain. Trees in Winter is an artists’ book designed, printed and bound by Elizabeth Castaldo of Forest Magic Press in 2018 and 2019. It was printed from photopolymer plates using CMYK process, with letterpress printing, handmade suminagashi marbles and hand cut paper. The book measures 5 x 7 inches and is enclosed in a slipcase. It was produced in an edition of 15, with collaphon signed and numbered by the artist. Trees in Winter **Please note that each book is made with unique suminagashi prints and this aspect of the book with vary with each edition. ** **Please note that each book is made with unique suminagashi prints and this aspect of the book with vary with each edition. **",

It considers how book arts have contributed to the recording of oppositional subjectivities in the U.S. The exhibition is titled after Audre Lorde’s 1977 essay on the intersections of creativity and activism that were not only essential to her own work but to a diverse group of feminist thinkers at the time. Recognizing that both creative work and activism are driven by subjectivity, Lorde argues that for women poetry is not a luxury but a vital necessity, as it provides a framework through which survival and the desire for change can be articulated, conceptualized, and transformed into meaningful action.

        "description": "This book was selected as AIGA’s 50 Books 50 Covers of 2019. 50 Books 50 Covers of 2019. Whitman is known today as an American poet, what is less known is his intimate knowledge and influence on the art of bookmaking. From his early days spent apprenticing as a newspaper printer, Whitman was involved in all aspects of bookmaking including writing, choosing the typeface and designing of the entire publication including binding, printing and editing. In his efforts to publish his own works, he oversaw all aspects of the production and often set type himself. Whitman truly experienced what it was like to make books and his hands on work allowed him to discover the anatomy of words and the creation of poetic space. The catalog for the exhibition celebrates Whitman’s involvement with the book as a vehicle for distributing his emerging ideas and reflects his sensibilities in terms of binding, paper, typography, images and overall innovative design. The artists’ work represented in the catalog follow Whitman’s experiments with printing and his reflections on the world around him especially on the emerging role of democracy in America. While Whitman lived over a century ago, his clusters of poetry and prose created from 1855 to 1892 continue to speak to the condition of the world especially now. His thoughts on democracy and immigration act as moral guardrails especially relevant today. The catalog highlights the work of artists who use the book format as their artistic medium and create work that reflects Whitman’s influence. Art included ranges from multiples, to limited editions and unique items addressing issues that Whitman wrote about including democracy, gender, immigration, history and observations of the world around us. Drawing inspiration from Whitman’s entire oeuvre, the selected works reproduced in the catalog range from letterpress to digital works including social media. Each work of art is presented with an image along with a description written by the artists. The catalog offers an essay by Deirdre Lawrence, the curator, and an interview with the curator by Corina Reynolds. Overall design is the product of the collaborative work of Corina Reynolds, director of the Center for Book Arts and co-founder of Small Editions, and Roni Gross, letter press artist and teacher and founder of Z’roah press. Small Editions Z’roah press The text for the book was set in Jansen, and Trajan, with titling in Normande. Various 19th century typefaces from the collection of Center for Book Arts was used for the quotations from Leaves of Grass. The end sheet is from Walt Whitman’s notebooks, courtesy of the Library of Congress. The catalog was printed and hand bound in New York City. This catalog — which can be seen as an artists’ book in its own right — offers striking images in color and black and white highlighting the work of 45 artists. Presented in a innovative folded binding, the catalog reflects Whitman’s artistic sensibilities and influence on the book arts",

        "description": "What does it mean to be in love with someone an ocean apart? How do you connect and create intimate space for yourselves when geography isn’t on your side? In a moment where technology is more often denounced as a wedge driving us further from one another, it can also be a bridge between two worlds, a space where we can be closer to those who are far. The work contained within Attenti al Cane is about that act and gesture, more than it is about the end product of an image. Attenti al Cane is an outstretched digital hand across the expanse that separates Laurel Hauge and Lele Buonerba. Within each image and page are the decisions they made in conjunction, not isolation. In the curation of each screen-capture of the twenty-six dogs found in this book is the relationship of those two and how they see the world within the framework of their trans-atlantic relationship. The dynamic, however, vastly differs from that of a penpal. Attenti al Cane is two lovers holding hands on an evening stroll, with the aid of Google, across the globe and through their longing to be side by side.",

        "description": "Text by Luciana Solano, curator Text by Luciana Solano, curator  In February 2018, I met Dalton Paula who was then in residence at AnnexB, a program dedicated to Brazilian artists in New York where I served as a board member. Through a series of studio visits that culminated in an artist talk at Residency Unlimited, Dalton and I examined racism and the language systems that perpetuate it; the black body; silenced black people; the African diaspora and its religions; performance and rituals; nature and healing; black protagonism. We also delved into Dalton’s choice of an earthy color palette; recurring symbols; non-duality; the feminine universe of women close to his heart; memories and the affection they convey. In our studio visits we used Dalton’s sketchbook to talk about his work. In it, he had drawings and watercolor studies he had made in preparation for large format oil paintings that were to be presented in the fourth New Museum Triennial, “Songs for Sabotage.” The primary purpose of his trip to New York was because he was one of the roughly thirty international emerging artists featured in the exhibition. In those days I was having ongoing conversations with a passionate book editor who was setting up a publishing house by the name of Familia Editions. Familia would specialize in artists’ books in collaboration with Brazilian contemporary artists. I introduced the publication’s founder to Dalton. That editor was Maria Lago and their collaboration is the artist book Visual Notes, Dalton Paula. Turning Dalton’s sketchbook into an artwork that will live in public libraries and art collections was an act of generosity and reverence only a mature and sensible editor could have made. Today, June 2021, post pandemic, it is moving to open the book’s orange casing and revisit the pages of Visual Notes. Dalton Paula. I think back to a statement in the New Museum Triennial’s introduction: “Through their distinct approaches, the artists in “Songs for Sabotage” offer models for dismantling and replacing the political and economic networks that envelop today’s global youth. Invoking the heightened role of identity in today’s culture, they take on the technological, economic, and material structures that stand in the way of collectivity.” Dalton’s work, and his deep and honest relationship to his identity, offers us a way forward. And we owe its enduring public expression to Familia. About the Artist Dalton Paula is represented by the galleries Sé Galeria, São Paulo and Alexander and Bonin NYC.

        "description": "The Earth has existed for billions of years. Ice Ages have come and gone. Life forms have evolved and evaporated. During recent millennia, however, and particularly since the industrial revolution, Earth’s human inhabitants have increasingly shaped the natural history of our planet, through such factors as agriculture, construction, mining, and manufacturing. So profound have been the changes we have wrought that this epoch recently has been accepted as constituting a geological era, the Anthropocene. Today we suffer the accelerated effects of our impact. Climate change is causing devastating hurricanes, droughts, fires, floods, and erosion. These affect the habitats of flora and fauna as well as human environments and productivity, migration and conflict. Toxins, pollutants, and trace elements contaminate ecosystems and food sup-plies. Humans have precipitated the Earth’s sixth phase of mass extinction. The artists in this exhibition respond to the ecological crises of our Anthropocene, which we ignore at the peril of our own ecocide. This exhibition catalogue includes an essay by Gary Van Wyk and artworks by Alma Collective (Christoph Both-Asmus/Owanto/Robbin Ami Silverberg/Andreas Wengel/Hervé Youmbi), Thorsten Baensch/Karin Dürr/Carolin Röckelein/Zoe Zin Moe), Sammy Baloji, Julie Dodd, Stephan Erasmus, Nuno Henrique, Daniel Knorr, Guy Lara-mée, Gideon Mendel, Barbara Milman, Heidi Neilson, Tara O’Brien, Sara Parkel, Susan Reynolds, Ian Van Coller, Shu-Ju Wang, Käthe Wenzel, Thomas Parker Williams, Michelle Wilson, and Philip Zimmermann.

        "description": "After reading the book The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben I was really moved by his description of the ways trees communicate and live in an almost society like way. He discusses the lives of trees almost as if they are human. Love Grows in the Forest, takes direct inspiration from Wohlelban’s book, focusing on the sentience of trees. This book developed quite spontaneously, beginning with some pressure prints I had made with a tree design, which have become the background layer of this book. Each next step was made in response to what was done before until I came out with a two layer accordion book with intricate hand cutting. The words of my poem inspired by Wohlleben’s book were then woven through this paper forest. The Hidden Life of Trees Love Grows in the Forest Love Grows in the Forest is a two layer accordion book designed, printed and bound by Elizabeth Castaldo of Forest Magic Press in 2018. It was made using pressure printing, hand set letterpress type, photopolymer, archival inkjet and hand cut paper. The book measures 10 inches tall and stretches to 55 inches long when fully opened. It was produced in an edition of 15, with collaphon signed and numbered by the artist.",

Nameless crosses are all that they have received by way of a burial.It is to honor the missing and their families that this object-book seeks to disseminate and communicate human rights’ violations in Chile. By documenting the identities of the victims, In Their Memory also invites reflection and puts forth a message of hope founded in truth. IN THEIR MEMORY Their Memory",

It is accompanied by a carved wooden board with a rawhide pouch nestled into the top. The pouch holds objects of carved soapstone, a horse bone, and a piece of metal shaped like a primitive knife. Perhaps the hunter would have held similar things. By holding these objects, the reader comes to know something of the life of the hunter; by placing them in the depressions of the board, they participate in the telling of the story. The knowing from the language and the knowing from the physical sensation are different, but each is powerful in its own way.",

I was feeling this strong sense of connection with the earth. I began to feel that this connection could never be broken no matter what happened and I started writing these thoughts down and soon had the poem that appears in the book. I created the imagery by layering prints on paper until things became clear to me with each print. Then I refined the imagery on each page and added the text. The versos feature hand sewn shapes of sacred geometry. Keepsake is about those things that become inexorably and eternally intertwined with our bodies and souls. Keepsake Keepsake is an artists’ book designed, printed and bound by Elizabeth Castaldo of Forest Magic Press in 2016. It was made with relief printing and photopolymer plates, with hand stitching on various papers. The book measures 4 inches in diameter, consists of 11 unbound pages and is enclosed in a mercury glass dish. It was produced in an edition of 12, with colophon signed and numbered by the artist.

        "description": "While performative art practice, with all of its nuances, remains largely fleeting, a significant number of artists, working mainly in interventions, performances, situations, and experiences, have generated a substantial material culture. Whether drafting steps for an action, making lists of performance materials, or giving directions for participants, the use of written language becomes a recurrent element in the enactment of the practice. This exhibition catalogue gives center stage to artist books, letters, notes, scripts, and texts produced side-by-side to, or in complicity with, these short-lived gestures. This book includes a foreword by Alexander Campos, essay by Nicolás Dumit Estévez, photos of the artworks, full checklist of works exhibited, and documentation of related Actions and Lecture Performances at Center for Book Arts. Nicolás Dumit Estévez Maria Alós, Josefina Báez, Paco Cao, Papo Colo, Billy X. Curmano, Irina Danilova, Jean-Ulrick Désert, Lesley Dill, Coco Fusco, Beatrice Glow, Alicia Grullón, Guerilla Girls, Pablo Helguera, Nancy Hwang, Alison Knowles, LuLu LoLo, Linda Mary Montano, Pat Oleszko, Pedro Pietri, Praxis (Brainard and Delia Carey), Quintin Rivera-Toro, Jack Smith, Elizabeth M. Stephens and Annie Sprinkle, Cecilia Vicuña, and Martha Wilson. Nicolás Dumit Estévez treads an elusive path that manifests itself performatively or through experiences where the quotidian and art overlap. He has exhibited and performed extensively in the U.S. as well as internationally at venues such as Madrid Abierto/ARCO, The IX Havana Biennial, PERFORMA 05 and 07, IDENSITAT, Prague Quadrennial, The Pontevedra Biennial, The Queens Museum of Art, MoMA, Printed Matter, P.S. 122, Hemispheric Institute of Performance Art and Politics, Princeton University, Rutgers University, The Institute for Art, Religion, and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary, The MacDowell Colony, Provisions Library, El Museo del Barrio, Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts, The Center for Book Arts, Longwood Art Gallery/BCA, The Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, Franklin Furnace, and Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, among others. During the past seven years Estévez has received mentorship in art in everyday life from Linda Mary Montano, a historic figure in the performance art field. Montano and Estévez have also collaborated on several performances. Residencies attended include P.S. 1/MoMA, Yaddo and the MacDowell Colony. He has received grants from Art Matters, Lambent Foundation, National Association of Latino Arts and Culture, Printed Matter and Puffin Foundation. Estévez Holds an MFA from Tyler School of Art, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA; and an MA from Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. Estévez has curated exhibitions and organized programs for El Museo del Barrio, the Institute for Art, Religion and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary, Longwood Art Gallery/Bronx Council on the Arts, and the Queens Museum of Art, New York; and for the Filmoteca de Andalucía, Córdoba, Spain. He is currently curating an exhibition from El Museo del Barrio’s permanent collection. Publications include Pleased to Meet You, Life as Material for Art and Vice Versa (editor) and For Art’s Sake. Born in Santiago de los Treinta Caballeros, Dominican Republic, in 2011 Estévez was baptized as a Bronxite; a citizen of the Bronx. Nicolás Dumit Estévez",

It features an interview with Seth Siegelaub, two essays by Regine Ehleiter and Michalis Pichler, and an extensively illustrated catalogue with bibliographic details. In preparation for the project, Siegelaub and Pichler met twice in Amsterdam, where they had a long recorded conversation about books, living with books, being intimately connected with books, and producing books, and about the recent emergence of contemporary publications that show clear reference to books Siegelaub had produced, both piracies and homages, and not always to his delight. Books by Siegelaub that are often paraphrased include the Xerox Book (1968), which was printed in offset and has since been xeroxed by various artists and publishers in many different ways, the catalogue exhibitions from 1969, as well as Lawrence Weiner’s Statements (1968). These publications are often taken as starting points for new projects, which are derivative and yet substantial artworks in their own right. Also, Siegelaub’s engagement with the Art Workers’ Coalition and subsequent draft of The Artist’s Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement has had wide reception and reaction in contemporary art and activism.",

        "description": "“This intense, remarkable, searing sequence takes, in seventeen steps, a journey to that place where the ancient reciprocity between the living and the dead (all but forgotten in a world of end-stopped sentences) is fully realized by a fragile mourner–along the way she becomes a poet of steel and pure spirit. Both brave and vulnerable, the poem is not an elegy for the loss of a friend, but a continuous movement from silence to singing, a movement that seeks, learns, and celebrates the edgelessness of all life. A friend has died, yes, but, as we learn in the preface, the teacher has died since; yet this poem is not entitled “I Had a Teacher” but “I Have a Teacher”; this in itself reveals the evaporating edge that not only removes all “punctuation”–beginnings, ends–from the poem, but removes as well all doubt. Such faith is rare, and beautiful, and abiding, as is the poem, this song sprung from a shell.”  –Mary Ruefle This beautiful chapbook was printed on the occasion of the author’s reading at Center for Book Arts in 2016. It was selected by Mary Ruefle as the winning manuscript of the CBA chapbook contest that year. Letterpress printed on wood veneer and Canaletto paper at Swamp Press. Hand bound in an edition of 100.

        "description": "In the summer of 1981, Ana Mendieta returned to Cuba for the first time after a long period of exile to reconnect with her ancestry and identity, working at las Escaleras de Jaruco, a national park outside Havana. Inside the limestone walls of the caves, she carved low-relief sculptures, naming her pieces Iyaré (Mother), Maroya (Moon), Guanaroca (The First Woman), Bacayú (Light of the Day), among others, and gathering them under the title, Rupestrian Sculptures Series. In 2012, I traveled twice to Cuba, in January and in June to document and study the carvings Mendieta had made in 1981. Mendieta photographed these works intending to publish a book of etchings titled Rupestrian Sculptures Series (transcription of artist’s notes, Clearwater 39 – 41); José Juan Arrom, then professor of anthropology at Yale and author of Mythology and Arts of the Prehispanic Antilles (1975), a work which deeply influenced Mendieta, was to write the preface for the book (Clearwater, artist’s notes, 40). Iyaré Maroya Guanaroca Bacayú Rupestrian Sculptures Series Rupestrian Sculptures Series Due to her untimely death in 1985, Mendieta did not finish the project. She completed only five of the twelve sets of photo etchings she had originally conceived, and signed only one of the completed portfolios, now held at the Art Institute of Chicago. Galerie Lelong then hired Liliana Porter to print the rest in 1993, which was followed by Clearwater’s facsimile edition, Ana Mendieta–A Book of Works (1993). Ana Mendieta–A Book of Works",

Kelli Anderson “Kelli Anderson is one of the most talented, thoughtful, inspiring young designers working today, bringing to each project an artist’s flair, a scientist’s rigor, and a philosopher’s deliberation.” —Maria Popova, Brainpickings Kelli Anderson is a designer and paper engineer whose work operates in the space between conceptual art, graphic design, and tech. Her whimsical books have featured a working paper planetarium, a pop-up pinhole camera, and a paper record player. Whenever she can, she uses humble, lo-fi materials to expose the invisible magic of the world and make abstract concepts “real” and tangible. Kelli’s work puts forth the idea that lo-fi, handheld experiences can challenge the notion of tech as an inaccesssible black box. Her first book, a functional pop-up camera titled, “This Book is a Camera,” was published by the Museum of Modern Art in 2016. Her paper record player invitation, her TED talk, and her work on Tinybop’s “The Human Body” are widely-beloved for showcasing the possibility hiding in plain view in our world.",

Sharon Dolin, who co-founded the Broadside Reading Series with former Center for Book Arts Executive Director Rory Golden, served as the curator for the anniversary reading series which began in the fall of 2014 and concluded in the spring of 2015. Dolin paired two past curators of the series, all of whom are poets, to create a new collaborative poem. At their readings each collaborating duo discussed the collaborative process and read their new poem along with their own poetry. Fourteen artists from CBA’s community were each invited to produce a limited edition of 150 broadsides for one of the collaborative poems, of which forty copies were used to create this 40th Anniversary Publication. This publication also include several unnumbered artist proofs. Using a format conceived by Ana Cordeiro, the Center’s 2015 summer interns, Jennifer Berry, Quincy Dean-Slobod, Emily Gross, Judy Gu, Matilda Ostow, and Ellis Suchmann, bound the publication under the direction of Artist Instructor-Stewards Nancy Loeber and Amber McMillan.

Like a medieval Book of Hours, various genres are represented, including diaries, dreams, academic papers, fictive prose, poetry, plays, and video and installation scripts. Each numbered volume is uniquely randomized. The algorithmic process allows the retrieval of memories in an arbitrary order, sifting associations. Source texts have been divided into paragraphs. Exiled from their original context, the character of the artist waxes and wanes according to their order and mix of actual, dreamt, or fictionalized experience. A kaleidoscopic reading imparts a visceral comprehension of the tenor of a life. Published by Weil Books and the recipient of a New York State Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in 2015. The paperback version has 10 different iterations, each with its own ISBN number, even though essentially they all have the same text- scrambled differently for different readings.",

Organized by Yulia Tikhonova Brother, Can You Spare a Stack presents thirteen art projects that re-imagine the library as a force for social change. Each project constructs a micro library of sorts that serves specific economic or social needs within the community. Each project proposes an alternative politicized realm, which can be imagined and formed to explore the social dimensions of contemporary culture. Small and mobile, these projects resist the limitations of a controlled, highly organized system that governs our society. In contrast to subjective libraries formed by the artists picking and choosing book titles, these projects take a pragmatic and rational approach, using the library model as an interactive field. Selected projects update the principles of relational aesthetics, and shift them towards all-inclusive and useful cultural production. “Brother, Can You Spare a Stack” borrows its title from the lyrics of a popular depression era song, claiming that the artists invent alternative models of questioning, inspiring new perspectives on social transformation. They insert themselves into the most unexpected situations and spaces, in this case libraries, to propose social and cultural improvement.",

The English term “Franco-Belgian comics” corresponds to the latter, narrower definition. It is geographically too restrictive, especially today, but does reflect the central role works published in Belgium and France have played in shaping this important tradition.",

With Fine & Dirty, the curators will assemble work that represents the best in letterpress books today, created by established and emerging artists. In so doing we hope to explore the forces that are reshaping the meanings of craft in letterpress printing in the twenty-first century, and that may shed light on the larger craft world’s relationship to art and to life. The exhibition will also investigate other influences on current letterpress work. These include DIY (Do It Yourself) and its playful organizational spin-off for letterpress, ILLSA (Impractical Labor in Service of the Speculative Arts); Asian influences such as wabi sabi; international influences such as, from the UK, Ken Campbell’s improvisatory approach and Ron King’s theatrical presentations, and, from Germany, a heightened focus on design and on a wide use of papers seen in work by Viktoria Schăpers and other Germans, and in work by Barbara Tetenbaum.

These publications document the process and politics of cancelation, exist as an alternative manifestation of the exhibit, act as a critique of the forces that called for its cancelation, or they may be an admission and exposition of an ultimately productive failure. In the context of the Center for Book Arts, Canceled highlights the book form as a crucial means of disseminating documentation and information on a wide and accessible scale, potentially in ways that are more historically stable, and more effective, than the original exhibition would have been. Through utilizing printed matter, these artists and curators have found alternative routes by which the politics surrounding the presentation and creation of art become at least as relevant as the work itself.",

        "description": "With a history of well over 1,500 years, Korean handmade paper, known as hanji, is familiar to Koreans but a mystery outside its home country. This lustrous paper that comes in a wide array of thickness, color, dimension, and translucency was once a coveted item inside and beyond Korean borders. Made by farmers and artisans during bitter cold winters, hanji was a noble marker of the literati who demanded high-quality paper for books, documents, calligraphy, and painting. Hanji also played a sacred role as the support for illuminated sutras, the body of temple decorations, and spirit of rituals where it was burned in hopes that its ashes would rise to the sky. Fashioned into objects that ranged from kites to armor to shrouds to chamber pots, there was seemingly no end to the possibilities of the combination of human ingenuity and paper through the transformation of natural fibers, until forces of history and industrialization collided and left this once-celebrated substrate and its related craft practices near extinction. In this first English-language book about hanji, Aimee Lee shares her experience as a Korean–American artist and Fulbright fellow on her search for a traditional Korean papermaking teacher. Of the handful of American hanji researchers, she is the only one to have interacted with Koreans in their own language while simultaneously learning the craft. This book follows her journey as she met papermakers, scholars, and artists from bustling cities to traditional Korean villages to Buddhist temples to island outposts. Not only did she encounter the few remaining papermakers who still practice webal tteugi, the indigenous Korean sheet-formation method, but she found teachers of a whole array of allied crafts that include jiseung—cording and weaving hanji, joomchi—texturing and felting hanji, natural dyeing, and calligraphy. She traveled from the studios of living treasures to the homes of ordinary Koreans, illuminating an often-misunderstood culture through stories from its keepers of traditional heritage.",

Artists who create these “Every” documents (i.e. everything I ate last year, every word I spoke one week, all the money I spent that month, etc), are struggling with the role of, and a lack of control over information. The “Every” documents featured in this exhibition respond to the filterers of information we rely upon in our daily lives-trusted sources that filter information into manageable content-by providing unfiltered documents of experience. These unfiltered, “Every” documents pose unique problems. Often massive in scale, they force us to contend with excess as an idea.",

        "description": "As a guest artist selected to represent ARTifariti in 2009, Robin Kahn spent a month living and cooking with Sahrawi women inside refugee camps in Algeria and in The Free Territories of the Western Sahara. There, she compiled this artist’s book using the sparse materials she either carried with her or found in the desert. Comprised of collaged photographs and text (both English and Spanish), it is a journal of recipes, histories, and drawings documenting how the Sahrawis blend tradition with innovation in preparing and serving food mostly supplied through foreign aid to their community. A testament to the daily struggles of a people who have lived in exile for 35 years, Kahn’s book uses the meal as a reflection of the women’s complex role in providing sustenance, fortitude, and a sense of tradition inside a compromised society.",

Ten American artists who have contributed articles and illustrations to Matrix will be featured, as well as English and European artists who have written and illustrated books for the Whittington Press. Miriam Macgregor, Hellmuth Weissenborn, Howard Phipps, John Craig and Judith Verity have worked closely with the Press, producing wood engravings, pochoir, and linocut illustrations for finely printed editions. John Randle and his wife Rose, proprietors of The Whittington Press, have created an environment where author, artist and printer, punchcutter and typecaster can work separately and together to explore their skills, nurturing each other through the vehicle of Matrix’s varied pages. American artists include Lowell Bodger, Carolee Campbell, Sandy Connors, Robin Heyeck, Jerry Kelly, Stan Nelson, Theo Rehak, Abigail Rorer and Gaylord Schanilec working in media that run the gamut of the book arts from calligraphy to creating type, from wood engraving to paper marbling and binding.",

It is what literally creates and defines us as a species; from the use of the word to signify the formation of amino acids by our RNA to the internal process whereby our cerebral cortex translates our thoughts into language. Using the term ‘translation’ in a generous and inclusive manner this exhibit examines our human struggle to transform human experience, perception, and thought and into acts and materials of communication. In particular this exhibit will focus on the success of this process and on what has been found rather than lost.",

These books shun the saccharin-sweet portrayals of life filled with friendly carnivores, golden-haired princesses, and stories that always end happily. The exhibition was inspired by traditional children’s stories like those told by the Brothers Grimm in the early 19th century. The artists’ books are decidedly less didactic, but still cognizant of the potential perils of innocence in the world of the late 20th century, though an element of humor is much more apparent. The books employ both traditional codex formats, as well as alternative book structures with pages that pop-up, fold out, or extend beyond their covers. Coordinated by Tracy Angel. On view April 12, 1996 – June 15, 1996.",

In all the works in this exhibition, paper is a form of tangible memory, and demonstrates human efforts to convert the products of the earth into a medium for expressing the thoughts of one person to another, one generation to those who will follow.

Each volume is proportional in size to a standing human figure, with a photographic portrait of the subject on the front cover; a portrait of them from the back on the back; and inside, the guts—life stories and perspectives told in short stories, vignettes and extended soliloquies. Expressive but very readable typographic/pictorial settings attempt to capture the shape of thought and reunite the spoken word with the printed page. The first four books in the series form a quartet of men. Together, they challenge traditional notions of madness, heroism, masculinity, and what a book can be. The Portrait Series",

Much of the literature contained here recounts small, personal injustices that feed a growing disillusionment with the promise of West German society. Westerners are sometimes perceived as self-interested and insensitive, often putting money-making above real unification. edition balance makes these sentiments tangible so that ideas can be exchanged and a path made toward fair solutions to these social problems. Recognizing the opportunities at hand, edition balance’s books express possibilities for a new society. edition balance edition balance’s This first American exhibition of books by edition balance offers viewers a change to see works which portray life in East Germany during socialist times, as well as during this crucial period of change, and bears witness to the power of the book as a means to communicating human experience. edition balance Includes an introduction by Executive Director Brian Hannon, an essay by Henry Günther and Marrion Günther-Bonsack, a checklist of 6 books and 6 broadsides, and an essay by Reinhard Grüner.",

Manhattan Laboratory Museum, Given similar experiences, needs and environments, parallel developments have occurred throughout history in not only fields of science and medicine but in the arts as well. The addition of the book to the vocabulary of artist’s devices has resulted in the creation of book-like objects both here and abroad. This exhibition, though modest in size presents a wide range of non-paper books from artists residing in New York, Illinois, California, Oregon, and from Germany. The art viewer here has an opportunity to see both the diversity and kinship of these works and at the same time, rethink his/her definition of “book”.",

        "description": "Guest curator, Clive Phillpot, said in May of 1982 of Collaborations, “I had two principle aims in selecting books for this exhibition. The first was to present multiple, mass-produced books by artists, which were inexpensive and available in unlimited editions. At the same time I wanted to make sure that visitors to the exhibition could handle the books and that any book which took their fancy could still be purchased. Collaborations My second aim was in the nature of an experiment. I wanted to exhibit books which were the result of artistic collaboration between the sexes Would the result of such collaborations possess different characteristics than those attributable to books made by individual artists? Would the soup thicken when another ingredient was added? The theme of collaborations as a theme was also due to my desire to use overt collaborations as a metaphor for the frequently unacknowledged collaboration between artists and photographer, compositor, printer, or publisher. Most books by artists are the result of collaborations, even though only one name may appear on the cover or title page. A printer, for example, may have a crucial role in determining the final form of a book. In the event a search for books which were the result of collaboration between men and women yielded too few titles…I therefore extended my search to books upon which women or men had collaborated an to works by groups of people. Extending the parameters of the search led me to more publications; collaboration is not uncommon among artists making books for mass-distribution – many different skills be employed and exhibited in the books medium. I was at this stage that I began to select, i.e., began to apply more subjective judgments to my accumulation of books. My own criteria for selection were not fully apparent to me until I had completed the process. select I subsequently realized that I had largely excluded awkward formats, funky bindings and anything artsy-crafty…I had focused principally upon what artists had done with the paperback – the most recent and ubiquitous physical form of the printed book. I also included books which, for the most part, had a professional finish to them; scrappy, thoughtless, amateurish publications were rejected. I was concerned about diversity of content for an exhibition such as this one, but my selection on the basis of form, fortuitously preserved just this desired diversity of content. At the same time this almost arbitrary slice from the pie of books by artists produced a colorful bunch of books, diverse in size, type, and country of origin. While not claiming that this small exhibition can be said to represent the whole spectrum of multiple books and bookworks by artists, I think that it is also close to being exemplary. The books range from pure, powerful, even educational, documentation of collaboraiton…to collaborative artworks in book form – book works… A closer examination of the books in the exhibition revels that many simply document activities in other media. However, it many also be apparent that documenting these activities in a book is sometimes the best or the only way to give from to them, and to communicate the full nature of the works to others… Every book employs photography in some way. In a few cases the photographs are directly manipulated…while in a couple of cases photographs are accompanied by drawings…Most, but not all of the books, use words in consecution with pictures. The words are generally essential to one’s reading of the images…",
