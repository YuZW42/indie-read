The drive for authentic goods and experiences fuels desire and like an enticing bit of social media, the sense of satisfaction vanishes into the stream of experience incredibly quickly once digested.\nAuthenticity is something that folks from a variety of creative fields grapple with. This includes designers, artists, photographers, illustrators, marketers, and philosophers.The Letter Ihas been written to help unpack why we feel so schizophrenic about our relationship with authenticity and consumption.\nTopics include the history of public relations; the assorted meanings of authenticity; the relationship between authenticity and nostalgia; the Beatles; authenticity and heroism; the meaning of taste; the relationship between authenticity and social media; authenticity and the gig economy.\nEdited by Taro Nettleton\nDesigned by Ian Lynam\nPublished by Wordshape, 2020\nSoftcover with gatefold, 48 pages, 4-color offset cover with 1-color interior, 5.8 × 8.3 inches"

But as long as they are at work, they are constrained by social forces over which they have little control—and which they have, unfortunately, shown little interest in grasping.”Approaching the turn of this century, graphic designers developed a series of critiques—formal, theoretical, and ethical—of their profession and its boundaries. In this brief intellectual history, J. Dakota Brown surveys the postmodern turn, the “First Things First” manifestos, and various collisions of graphic design with more established disciplines. A common thread of these efforts, Brown argues, was a yearning for autonomy: an attempt to develop design’s potential beyond the needs of commercial practice. As this essay illustrates, however, the dream of autonomy remains frustrated and politically ambivalent: a symptom of designers’ inability to confront the capitalist imperatives that shape their working lives.\nPublished by Green Lantern Press, 2019Second edition, 300 copies\nSoftcover, 36 pages, b&w interior with 2-color Risograph cover, 5.5 × 7.5 inches"

Many more sell for just a few dollars or don’t sell at all.\nAre eBay sellers with a lot of TV time on their hands and the need for cash becoming our new media archivists? These video data farmers are an important link in the digital preservation chain for all kinds of material. Local history and newscasts, commercials, broadcasts that stations never saved, films that never officially made it onto VHS or DVD or are out of print, key social and political events, and more wind up on home recordings.\nOnce watched, described, listed, and purchased, these tapes may be converted from analog to digital and uploaded to various websites for wider public consumption by other video obsessives, researchers, and historians. As the magnetic tape in these objects degrades, the clock is ticking for people who want to view and save this stuff.\nThe reprinted excerpts in this booklet were selected from completed eBay auctions held in 2019. The most obsessive of these listings reveal hours of watching and note-taking with the obvious hope that some nugget of footage will be the precise thing a buyer has been searching for.\nPhotos of the image quality shot off of a TV screen are also included in some listings.\nPublished by Public Collectors, 2019Printed in a limited edition of 273 copiesPublic Collectors booklet #38\nSoftcover, 24 pages, saddle-stiched binding, 2-color Risograph, 5.5 × 8.5 inches"

It was common for an envelope to explode with these bits of this and that—all modest attempts to spread the word, drum up some orders or correspondence, and reach new audiences. Zines used them to solicit demo tapes for review and new writing to publish. Bands used them to sell their tapes and records. Given the vast number of people that were engaged in pen pal relationships and tape and zine trading, many thousands of these slips of paper moved back and forth all over the world.\nIn addition to a short booklet that includes quotes from some zine-makers, band members and record labels about this practice, the main feature here is the recreation of 66 facsimiles of these little ads... Essentially, this edition is a portable exhibit of designed and printed paper bits that many people made and used, but far fewer people thought to save.\nHardcore Architecture: Thrash Advertisingis produced under the umbrella of Hardcore Architecture, a project by Chicago's Public Collectors. Hardcore Architecture explores the relationship between the architecture of living spaces and the history of underground hardcore bands in the 1980s. This publication focuses on the domestic homespun production aspects of underground music and publishing culture, and is one of a series of printed works addressing the broader themes of Hardcore Architecture through writings, interviews, photos, and printed ephemera.\nPublished by Public Collectors, 2018Printed in a limited edition of 275 copies\n8-page booklet with printed envelope + 66 loose printed inserts and 2 stickers, 5-color RISO with offset and digital printing, 10.5 × 7.5 inches"

(This is somewhat unusual—in my opinion, most data visualizations neuter the politics of the source of data in favor of taming the information into easily digestible end products.) Both projects rely on the data inherent to Google Maps. Begun as a C++ desktop program by brothers Lars and Jens Rasmussen, their experiment was bought by Google in 2004, becoming part of that company’s quest “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” I sat down to talk with Justin as one way into understanding the politics of Google Maps and Street View, and also the larger desire to map the relationship between architecture and data.\"\nHardcore Architecture: Justin Blinderis the fourth publication in the Hardcore Architecture interview series.

Grace took the helm of this legendary monthly DIY punk publication when she was barely in her mid-20s, moving across the country to San Francisco to begin her life as a “full-time professional punk.”The interview details Ambrose's personal background and history as well as her experience at MRR, which was founded in 1977 by Tim Yohannan (1945-1998). As the magazine neared its 400th issue, its legacy was apparent: each monthly copy topped a hundred pages, with thousands of words and column upon column devoted to punk culture around the world. Surviving and even thriving during a period of hardship for most print publications, MRR's history mirrors the waves of interest in punk music itself. As a magazine about subculture printed continuously between 1982 and 2019, MRR also serves as an important source and evidentiary document of hardcore and punk history.This booklet is a must for those interested in the mechanics of running an independent monthly magazine, punk history, radical history in San Francisco, and DIY publishing. Discussion of Tim Yohannon's ghost is also included, along with photographs and a diagram of MRR headquarters.By Grace Ambrose, Marc Fischer, and Public Collectors\nPublished by Half Letter PressFirst edition, 2016Printed in an edition of 500\nSoftcover, 24 pages, two-color Risograph, and full color digital, 8.5 x 11 inches"

I wrote this booklet for those of us who have ever felt stuck, because somehow, it can feel like The Apocalypse... Doomsday. Ragnarok. Armageddon. (Or at least for me it has on occasion.)”\nVisual Strategies for the Apocalypsegets past that by examining why and how the visual form is defined and dealt with, as well as how we might re-engage ourselves with it.\nTopics include: the relationship between Big Tech and child labor; the even more complicated relationship between fast fashion and Thor, god of Thunder; space, time, and selfishness; contrast, cropping, and partying; chance processes; imitation, flattery, history, and desktop publishing; collage as strategy; the function of drawing; ornament, and making things up.\nWith contributions from leading designers and design educators: Matthew Scott Barnes, Natalia Ilyin, Nikki Juen, Yoon Soo Lee, Matthew Monk, David Peacock, Michael Scaringe, and Lorena Howard-Sheridan, along with Laura Bernstein, James Chae, Taylor Giali, James Hultquist-Todd of JTD Type, James Edmondson of Oh No Type Co, visual artist Griffin McPartland, Adolf Loos and the late Koichi Sato.\nEdited by Catherine Dale\nPublished by Wordshape, 2019\nSoftcover, 112 pages, 3-color offset, 6.8 × 8.25 inches"

        "desc": "William Crawford's drawings were discovered in an abandoned house in Oakland, California. His work brings to mind characteristics of prison drawings, an impression confirmed by the fact that several were made on the backs of prison roster sheets dated 1997. These printouts, however, were cut down the middle, so the exact prison from which they originate is unknown. But given their origin in the Bay Area and the fact that several drawings include San Francisco landmarks, it's possible that Crawford made the work in a California state prison. Other than this information drawn from the archive itself, nothing is known about Crawford's life. Indeed, we only know his name because he signed a few of the drawings, either as Bill, William or WM Crawford.The discovered collection appears to have consisted of several books, with individual drawings in sequences of 30 or more adding up to tell complex visual stories. Several include written captions or fragments of conversation between male and female characters. These sequences, however, have been broken up over the years and reach us now in a fragmentary and fascinating grouping of hundreds of delicate pencil drawings. The work conveys the intense sense of sexual longing of a man with an urge to tell dynamic stories.The drawings, which resemble the eroticism of Eric Stanton, the exaggerated male anatomy of Tom of Finland or the ample breasts of a John Currin, show scantily dressed women, drug use, cuckolding and orgies. The details of his interiors, the hairdos and style of dress suggest that Crawford might have come of age in the late 70s or early 80s. A cast of recurring figures populate the drawings, notably one man with a short afro and a moustache who often figures at the center of events, presumably the artist William Crawford himself.Remarkably, given the number of drawings, there is little to no repetition in the work. Crawford’s inventive eye for sexual positions, facial expressions and gestures of hand and body was vast and masterful. Simple geometric details and architectural subtleties define the unusual settings where the action unfolds. We see rooms shown from unusual angles, features that are hinted at, erased or altogether omitted and articles of clothing that are drawn with obsessive precision. This singular and original drawing style compels us to immerse ourselves in the world William Crawford created, more dream than documentation, more fantasy than perversion.Crawford's drawings have been widely exhibited, notably at Galerie Susanne Zander (Cologne and Berlin); Zieher, Smith and Horton (New York); Freddy (Baltimore); and solo exhibitions at FARAGO (Los Angeles) and Richardson (New York). His work was featured in the Richardson Magazine and was included in \"System and Vision\" at David Zwirner, an exhibition organized in collaboration with Delmes & Zander. Reviewing it,The New Yorkerwrote: \"William Crawford's orgiastic illustrations on the backs of prison rosters have an erotic intensity that rivals anything by Hans Bellmer or Pierre Klossowski.\"\nPublished by Innen, 2016Printed in a limited edition of 500 copies\nSoftcover, 32 pages, stapled, black and white offset, 5.12 × 7.48 inches"

        "desc": "Tendencyis a publication focused on human behavior in modern society, initiated by Jakarta, Indonesia's Scouting Unit.\nThe idea behind this zine is forged from a curiosity that has been eternally present among humans—the impulse to understand others. As human beings,we strive to be better by learning about others, by taking positive influences and shaping them into our own character. But to understand someone completely, we would need to spend most of our time with them—watching and understanding how they live their lives. Perhaps even then, we still would be unable to understand them in toto.\nOur minds wonder about the minds of others—how they think and how they arrive at particular decisions. What makes themthem?\nAnd when it comes to human interactions, people may not always be able to show the real version/s of themselves. But Scouting Unit proposes that when individuals are by themselves—without others looking on—we become who we really are. When we are alone with things personal to us—perhaps our smartphones or personal computer—we reveal ourselves as we really are.\nDesigned by Table Six Studio\nPublished by Scouting Unit\nSoftcover, 68 pages, 1-color Risograph, 5 × 9.75 inchesIncludes one set of stickers"

Erlings's detailed drawings capture the materiality, texture, and physicality of the stone and marble sculptures, with the Risograph printing of her images adding a layer of texture. All of the works inMYNDare representations of the female body, sometimes headless and occasionally abstracted. Erlings works from reference images found in 1960s catalogs, where the image quality and high contrasts of sixties-era printing created dynamic, bold copies. Evocative and sensual, the drawings in this blue-toned publication celebrate form, shape, and the intricacies of the female form as interpreted by artists from different generations.\nPublished by Iris Erlings\nPrinted by Hato Press\n24 pages, 1-color Risograph, 7.25 × 9.84 inches"
