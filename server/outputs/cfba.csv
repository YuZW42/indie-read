5,304.0,2024.0,Coup de Dés (Collection) Books and Ideas After Mallarmé (PREORDER),Michalis Pichler,35.0,6.75 x 9.5 inches,,"By now the appropriation of Mallarmé, and in particular of his Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard, constitutes a genre of its own. Coup de Dés (Collection) attempts to gather, present and contextualize the numerous editions, re-editions, appropriations of Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard, including those attributed to Mallarmé as well as those which claimed by artists as new works in their own right. Moreover, the collection comprises publications, of whatever genre, which feature the word-constellation “Coup de Dés” on their cover. Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard Coup de Dés (Collection) Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard Un Coup de Dés (Collection) is a book about books, a collection, a gathering of evidence, a critical investigation, and an anthology of artists books. The book will catalogue all the books in its accompanying exhibition with meticulous bibliographic details, will be richly illustrated, and will be accompanied by critical essays written by leading scholars of the field such as Annette Gilbert, Craig Dworkin, Luc Boltanski/Arnauld Esquerre, Michalis Pichler and Ryoko Sekiguchi. Un Coup de Dés (Collection) “Books and Ideas Mallarmé” explores how Mallarmé’s Coup came about in the first place and how the absence of an authoritative edition contributed to keeping its exact status indeterminate, making it intertextual text par excellance. Coup par excellance Also, it looks at the Coup which has become a reference piece that gets appropriated with increasing frequency by contemporary artists and authors, who often operate independently from the commercial gallery system, gather around the networks of art book fairs, and have contributed to a wide-ranging bibliographic discourse within a field that has been subsumed under the umbrella term publishing as artistic practice. The research and the represented books all question the notion of the publication as a neutral container for information, and argue for a consideration of the physical shape and structure of text, of publications and of their materialization. Coup publishing as artistic practice Besides Stéphane Mallarmé, this anthology features books and bookworks by authors such as Derek Beaulieu, Jérémie Bennequin, Marcel Broodthaers4, burozoique, Bernard Chiavelli, Jim Clinefelter, Mario Diacono, Sammy Engramer, Cerith Wyn Evans, Ernest Fraenkel, Angela Grasser, Elsworth Kelly, La Bibliothèque Fantastique, Brian Larosche, Benjamin Lord, Michael Maranda, Guido Molinari, Monchas, Nontsikelelo Mutiti, Aurélie Noury, Raffaella Dell’Olga, Michalis Pichler, Nicolas Richard, Sam Sampson6,7,8, Camille Soula, Klara Vith5,6, Eric Zboya, and many more.

Children’s Activity Books are a popular genre of publication meant to be in equal parts educational and entertaining. Often thematic in nature and printed on cheap gray paper, they are filled with coloring pages, and well known games and puzzles such as Word Search and Spot the Difference. From Can You See What I See? In Can You See What I See?, the coloring pages, rather than featuring popular cartoon characters or farm animals, consist of line-based compositions based on contemporary and historical military camouflage patterns from around the world. Word Search puzzles prompt viewers to identify missile and fighter jets that were named after animals or common weather phenomena. Spot the sniper, another set of images that appears throughout the book, is based on the Hidden Object Puzzle – a learning game asking children to find objects in a busy composition.

14,88.0,2022.0,Restored/Access,,32.0,7 x 10 inches,,"With texts by Keko Jackson and Matthew Grumbach “Allensworth is the first town in California to be founded, financed, and governed exclusively by Black people. Founded in 1908 as a symbol of freedom in the West, it is part of a long legacy of independent and autonomous communities created by revolutionaries and people who escaped enslavement. The town was started by Allen Allensworth, who was himself born into enslavement, and saw the land as an opportunity to live out a version of the American Dream. In its early years Allensworth saw a lot of success and self-sufficiency, establishing a free public library, access to inexpensive land and resources and a system of cooperative economics. However by 1915, a variety of causes including severe drought, racially motivated attacks, and the discovery of arsenic in the ground water ultimately led to the town’s decline. Today, Allensworth remains a state park which attempts to preserve the unique history of the land. While the demographics have largely shifted, Tulare County continues to be one of the poorest counties in the state. With this project I hope to share the story and history of a place I never learned about until coming across some boxes at my uncle’s house. By combining my own images with archival materials from his collection I attempt to bring together visual narratives both past and present to illustrate the evolution of a town that once meant so much to so many.” —Keko Jackson Keko Jackson is an artist and archivist based in Los Angeles.

It consists of three volumes. The actual text of the constitution and amendments are set in a typeface that at first glance appears like an archaic alphabet but becomes legible as one reads. This volume is contained within an acrylic vitrine as it it is an inaccessible artifact. The two other volumes are the “interpretations.” One is a redacted version of the text that is inspired by the idea that most constitutional zealots get their information from biased news commentators which is similar to reading a redacted text. The other interpretation is inspired by the idea that the other primary source of constitutional information is the internet.

As both a love letter and a lament to the airplane, it speaks to ways both individuals and meaning get transported to multiple and sometimes unexpected destinations; and how, like language itself, the airplane becomes a symbol of hope. As a border-blurring text incorporating elements of visual poetry/concrete work, asemic/sound poetry, theoretical discourse, and poetic, philosophical, and Kabbalistic aphorisms, Ærotomania highlights how language–an ever-swirling palimpsest of spectral voices, textures, whispers, and codes–transports us through passion, politics, pleasure, and promise as we negotiate loss and light towards new ways of seeing and being; and, like the airplane, flies through a variety of zones and registers, soaring to higher and higher levels, carrying its passengers through radically transformative possibilities.

While we have encountered a few obstacles in the production of the print edition of the magazine, we are greatly encouraged by the response we have received to the initiative and to the contents of Issue 1 online. We continue to see enthusiasm for a platform to engage with the artists’ book as an object and discuss how and why it works as an object—and for building and expanding a community with whom to share the excitement and fun of such conversations. 2022 has seen the return of in-person book fairs and the opportunity to come together to look at and talk about artists’ books along with questions of social responsibility, sustainability, and ethics. These topics are important parts of BAR and we hope you will join us in this dialogue. Add your voice and let us know what you think of our direction, design, and ideas and pitch us with your writing. Book Art Review  With Issue 2, we examine the “Hidden Parts of Design and Publishing.” How do the decisions that unfold during the process of bringing an artists’ book from conception to delivery reflect tradeoffs between an artist’s ideas and practical constraints of design, materials, and production? How do discussions between the collaborators impact the book? And how do the economics of the book shape the content and form? We are excited to have a range of writers exploring these questions across a broad spectrum of codex and non-traditional forms of the book. For Issue 2, we have partnered with Clifton Meador and his students at Appalachian State University to work on the design and production of this issue and are including their thoughts on going through this process with us. Finally, thank you for your patience as we smooth out our processes and settle on a more regular semi-annual cadence. Sincerely, The Editors Book Art Review (BAR) is a semiannual magazine dedicated to providing a forum for critical writing about book art and artist books.

The risograph under-layer is created from three hand painted images layered together to create a rainbow. The black letterpress print on top is made from an image of a collage of screenprints of marbled paper (how is that for a visual game of telephone?) that has been reworked to create areas of space where it is possible to see through to the under-layer only. The narrative of the print is of a smiling bookbinder—or aspiring bookbinder—entering the magical jungle of bookbinding. Printed by Allison Carter-Beaulé at Center for Book Arts. About the Artist Sheryl Oppenheim was born in 1983 and raised in Orlando, Florida. She is a painter, paper marbler, and maker of illegible books, an idea she first became interested in after seeing the work of Bruno Munari, and through her proximity to books, bookbinders, and marbled paper at her first job in New York, at a bookbinding supply house. She began marbling paper in 2011 and began learning Suminagashi in 2016. Her artist books and prints are included in public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Watson Library, the Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center, the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Museum, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts. She has participated in recent exhibitions at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts, Sadie Halie Projects, Deanna Evans Projects, International Print Center New York, Small Editions, and the Cranbrook Museum of Art. Oppenheim received her BA from Brandeis University and her MFA from Temple University’s Tyler School of Art.

Book Art Review For subscribers who are renewing, we’ve got you covered. Your BAR subscription will pick up exactly where you left off. Thank you for subscribing to Book Art Review.

Did you ever wonder how artists and writers made zines and chapbooks before computers and photocopiers? This book is the culmination of over a decade of experiments, research, and tinkering with pre-digital duplication technology. It’s a DIY guide that explains the history and how-to of the mimeograph, hectograph, and spirit duplicators that were used by the avant-garde, political radicals, wannabe publishers, low-brow artists, and—perhaps most famously—by early zine makers. In addition to the how-to manual, the book is also a meditation on technology, highbrow vs lowbrow art, and rediscovering freedom in the non-digital world. This book is packed with info, instructions, illustrations, and reference material that will help you get started printing zines, posters, flyers, stickers, and more, without fancy equipment or expensive supplies. What the HELL are mimeos and hectos? Is a Spirit Duplicator some weird religious thing? The printing techniques featured in the book include low-cost, common “copying” methods that require little or no specialized training or equipment. Hectography Hecto appeared in the 1870s and was used widely for making office or school copies. It’s an amazingly simple technology, requiring no mechanical devices. By mixing gelatin and glycerin, you can make a printing pad that can produce 40 copies, be wiped clean, and be used again and again. Spirit Duplication An offshoot of hectography, spirit duplicator machines are a type of tabletop cylinder press. The master sheet is wrapped around a drum, which is hand-cranked or motorized. Known as “Ditto Machines, ” they make purple copies with an intoxicating smell loved by schoolkids everywhere. Mimeography Mimeos are stencil duplicators that can still be found second-hand, or you can make your own! Similar to silkscreen or Riso printing, mimeo offers a broad range of color choices and can print many more copies than the spirit method.",,"['https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CheapCopies1__95727.jpeg', 'https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CheapCopies2__07978.jpeg', 'https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CheapCopies6__65238.jpeg', 'https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CheapCopies3__63921.jpeg']",Obsolete Press,unlimited,Wire-o Softcover,
