Coup de Dés (Collection) attempts to gather, present and contextualize the numerous editions, re-editions, appropriations of Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard, including those attributed to Mallarmé as well as those which claimed by artists as new works in their own right. Moreover, the collection comprises publications, of whatever genre, which feature the word-constellation “Coup de Dés” on their cover. Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard Coup de Dés (Collection) Un Coup de Dés Jamais N’Abolira le Hasard Un Coup de Dés (Collection) is a book about books, a collection, a gathering of evidence, a critical investigation, and an anthology of artists books. The book will catalogue all the books in its accompanying exhibition with meticulous bibliographic details, will be richly illustrated, and will be accompanied by critical essays written by leading scholars of the field such as Annette Gilbert, Craig Dworkin, Luc Boltanski/Arnauld Esquerre, Michalis Pichler and Ryoko Sekiguchi. Un Coup de Dés (Collection) “Books and Ideas Mallarmé” explores how Mallarmé’s Coup came about in the first place and how the absence of an authoritative edition contributed to keeping its exact status indeterminate, making it intertextual text par excellance. Coup par excellance Also, it looks at the Coup which has become a reference piece that gets appropriated with increasing frequency by contemporary artists and authors, who often operate independently from the commercial gallery system, gather around the networks of art book fairs, and have contributed to a wide-ranging bibliographic discourse within a field that has been subsumed under the umbrella term publishing as artistic practice. The research and the represented books all question the notion of the publication as a neutral container for information, and argue for a consideration of the physical shape and structure of text, of publications and of their materialization. Coup publishing as artistic practice Besides Stéphane Mallarmé, this anthology features books and bookworks by authors such as Derek Beaulieu, Jérémie Bennequin, Marcel Broodthaers4, burozoique, Bernard Chiavelli, Jim Clinefelter, Mario Diacono, Sammy Engramer, Cerith Wyn Evans, Ernest Fraenkel, Angela Grasser, Elsworth Kelly, La Bibliothèque Fantastique, Brian Larosche, Benjamin Lord, Michael Maranda, Guido Molinari, Monchas, Nontsikelelo Mutiti, Aurélie Noury, Raffaella Dell’Olga, Michalis Pichler, Nicolas Richard, Sam Sampson6,7,8, Camille Soula, Klara Vith5,6, Eric Zboya, and many more.

In Can You See What I See?, the coloring pages, rather than featuring popular cartoon characters or farm animals, consist of line-based compositions based on contemporary and historical military camouflage patterns from around the world.

Founded in 1908 as a symbol of freedom in the West, it is part of a long legacy of independent and autonomous communities created by revolutionaries and people who escaped enslavement. The town was started by Allen Allensworth, who was himself born into enslavement, and saw the land as an opportunity to live out a version of the American Dream. In its early years Allensworth saw a lot of success and self-sufficiency, establishing a free public library, access to inexpensive land and resources and a system of cooperative economics. However by 1915, a variety of causes including severe drought, racially motivated attacks, and the discovery of arsenic in the ground water ultimately led to the town’s decline. Today, Allensworth remains a state park which attempts to preserve the unique history of the land. While the demographics have largely shifted, Tulare County continues to be one of the poorest counties in the state. With this project I hope to share the story and history of a place I never learned about until coming across some boxes at my uncle’s house. By combining my own images with archival materials from his collection I attempt to bring together visual narratives both past and present to illustrate the evolution of a town that once meant so much to so many.” —Keko Jackson Keko Jackson is an artist and archivist based in Los Angeles.

This volume is contained within an acrylic vitrine as it it is an inaccessible artifact. The two other volumes are the “interpretations.” One is a redacted version of the text that is inspired by the idea that most constitutional zealots get their information from biased news commentators which is similar to reading a redacted text. The other interpretation is inspired by the idea that the other primary source of constitutional information is the internet.

As a border-blurring text incorporating elements of visual poetry/concrete work, asemic/sound poetry, theoretical discourse, and poetic, philosophical, and Kabbalistic aphorisms, Ærotomania highlights how language–an ever-swirling palimpsest of spectral voices, textures, whispers, and codes–transports us through passion, politics, pleasure, and promise as we negotiate loss and light towards new ways of seeing and being; and, like the airplane, flies through a variety of zones and registers, soaring to higher and higher levels, carrying its passengers through radically transformative possibilities.

While we have encountered a few obstacles in the production of the print edition of the magazine, we are greatly encouraged by the response we have received to the initiative and to the contents of Issue 1 online. We continue to see enthusiasm for a platform to engage with the artists’ book as an object and discuss how and why it works as an object—and for building and expanding a community with whom to share the excitement and fun of such conversations. 2022 has seen the return of in-person book fairs and the opportunity to come together to look at and talk about artists’ books along with questions of social responsibility, sustainability, and ethics. These topics are important parts of BAR and we hope you will join us in this dialogue. Add your voice and let us know what you think of our direction, design, and ideas and pitch us with your writing. Book Art Review  With Issue 2, we examine the “Hidden Parts of Design and Publishing.” How do the decisions that unfold during the process of bringing an artists’ book from conception to delivery reflect tradeoffs between an artist’s ideas and practical constraints of design, materials, and production? How do discussions between the collaborators impact the book? And how do the economics of the book shape the content and form? We are excited to have a range of writers exploring these questions across a broad spectrum of codex and non-traditional forms of the book. For Issue 2, we have partnered with Clifton Meador and his students at Appalachian State University to work on the design and production of this issue and are including their thoughts on going through this process with us. Finally, thank you for your patience as we smooth out our processes and settle on a more regular semi-annual cadence. Sincerely, The Editors Book Art Review (BAR) is a semiannual magazine dedicated to providing a forum for critical writing about book art and artist books. Book Art Review Book Art Review publishes two issues per year, with the first issue launching in Fall 2021. We want to raise the bar for book art criticism! BAR is our plan to make book art criticism more visible and more valuable, and to engage with a diverse group of writers and readers. Our launching manifesto calls for “New Book Art Criticism,” and in building that, our magazine will showcase a new kind of writing about artist books, one that focuses on the material, paginated, object qualities of the book.

About the Artist Sheryl Oppenheim was born in 1983 and raised in Orlando, Florida. She is a painter, paper marbler, and maker of illegible books, an idea she first became interested in after seeing the work of Bruno Munari, and through her proximity to books, bookbinders, and marbled paper at her first job in New York, at a bookbinding supply house. She began marbling paper in 2011 and began learning Suminagashi in 2016. Her artist books and prints are included in public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Watson Library, the Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center, the New York Public Library, the Brooklyn Museum, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts. She has participated in recent exhibitions at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts, Sadie Halie Projects, Deanna Evans Projects, International Print Center New York, Small Editions, and the Cranbrook Museum of Art.

Did you ever wonder how artists and writers made zines and chapbooks before computers and photocopiers? This book is the culmination of over a decade of experiments, research, and tinkering with pre-digital duplication technology. It’s a DIY guide that explains the history and how-to of the mimeograph, hectograph, and spirit duplicators that were used by the avant-garde, political radicals, wannabe publishers, low-brow artists, and—perhaps most famously—by early zine makers. In addition to the how-to manual, the book is also a meditation on technology, highbrow vs lowbrow art, and rediscovering freedom in the non-digital world. This book is packed with info, instructions, illustrations, and reference material that will help you get started printing zines, posters, flyers, stickers, and more, without fancy equipment or expensive supplies. What the HELL are mimeos and hectos? Is a Spirit Duplicator some weird religious thing? The printing techniques featured in the book include low-cost, common “copying” methods that require little or no specialized training or equipment. Hectography Hecto appeared in the 1870s and was used widely for making office or school copies. It’s an amazingly simple technology, requiring no mechanical devices. By mixing gelatin and glycerin, you can make a printing pad that can produce 40 copies, be wiped clean, and be used again and again. Spirit Duplication An offshoot of hectography, spirit duplicator machines are a type of tabletop cylinder press. The master sheet is wrapped around a drum, which is hand-cranked or motorized. Known as “Ditto Machines, ” they make purple copies with an intoxicating smell loved by schoolkids everywhere. Mimeography Mimeos are stencil duplicators that can still be found second-hand, or you can make your own! Similar to silkscreen or Riso printing, mimeo offers a broad range of color choices and can print many more copies than the spirit method.",,"['https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CheapCopies1__95727.jpeg', 'https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CheapCopies2__07978.jpeg', 'https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CheapCopies6__65238.jpeg', 'https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CheapCopies3__63921.jpeg']",Obsolete Press,unlimited,Wire-o Softcover,

Liberty,,9 x 12 inches,,"Sur Rodney (Sur) In the history of art, craft and conceptual art are often placed at odds. Craft emphasizes the materiality of the object, while conceptual art emphasizes the dematerialization of the object. But artists’ books offer a unique merging of these premises in the book’s status as a conceptual, tactile, and often ephemeral object. Successful artists’ books blend the craft of its making—paper, binding, scale, and printing method—with a conceptual premise tied to its status as time-based media in which the idea of the book—sequence, repetition, and audience activation—is essential to its meaning. While early exhibitions and writing on artists’ books maintained both these practices, including unique and small-edition handmade books that verge towards sculpture alongside mass-produced photobooks, paperbacks, and stapled zines, the history of artists’ books has since shifted, primitizing only the democracy of the genre and ghettoizing expensive, unique, and sculptural bookworks. The book focuses on book art production beginning in the mid 1960s that was exhibited from 1973-1996, drawing a—albeit zig-zag—line from the first cited US exhibition of artists’ books at Moore College to the founding of San Francisco Center for the Book, charting an expanding definition, practice, and legacy of bookmaking across the US. It will include a range of artists, from Liliana Porter, Howardena Pindell, and Suzanne Lacy, to Barton Lidice Beneš and Sas Colby. Leaning heavily on the archives and exhibition history of institutions devoted to craft and conceptual art, this exhibition will revisit who and what was considered an “artists’ book.” In doing so, Craft & Conceptual Art will shed new light on both ends of the sliding scale between craft and conceptual art, allowing us to better understand the growing field of artists’ book production. This fully illustrated catalogue features additional contributions by Sur Rodney (Sur), David Senior, Kayleigh Perkov, and Tara Aisha Willis, and a selection of reprinted historical texts.

Berger. Showcasing marbled paper, paste paper, fold-and-dye papers, and more, this book reveals a little-known arts phenomenon from its grass roots in the 1960s to artistic heights in the following decades Pattern and Flow chronicles the flourishing of American decorated paper arts beginning in the 1960s and extending to the 2000s, with an ongoing legacy today. As knowledge and skills were shared across a grass‐roots community in the 1960s, decorated paper became increasingly popular, with centers for the study of the book and paper arts emerging across the United States, and artists developing new, innovative styles of paper. The book begins with an introductory essay outlining the history of decorated paper arts in America up to the 1960s, followed by a chronological narrative, which surveys the development of the field and introduces the artists working from the 1960s to the 2000s, and an illustrated reference section with essential biographical and professional information for each artist. Designed to be an immersive experience, Pattern and Flow conveys the vivid visual world of American decorated paper, celebrating the variety and variations that are key features of the art. Stunning illustrations show designs with intricate, tessellated patterns and others that flow with forms and waves that seem liquid; some explore subtle, muted tones, while others are explosive in their use of brilliant colors.

My wife, Noni Reisner, had dementia I cared for her for 6 years. She was a very funny, witty person, and that sense of humor and wit continued during her dementia. She would say these short sayings and I started to write them down on any piece of paper I could grab. Backs of envelopes, shopping lists, etc. While caring for her I did little artwork but I did make a few drawings. A few years after she died I started the watercolors and drawings that make up this book. It was the book designer Laura Lindgren who suggested that I combine them with Noni’s sayings that I collected and make a book which she helped design. This book is a kind of visual memoir of that difficult yet spiritual time.",,['https://centerforbookarts.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/lenny_silverberg_either-way-its-perfect-1.jpeg'],Lenny Silverberg,,,978-0-578-65729-5
